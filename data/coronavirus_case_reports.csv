0,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most important human viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It can be asymptomatic or it can present in any of its 3clinical forms: Dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. However, some atypical manifestations have been reported in surgical emergencies caused by acute appendicitis in patients with dengue fever. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of an 18-year-old Mexican male who presented to the emergency department of the General Hospital of Culiacan, Sinaloa, with symptoms of dengue fever, accompanied by crampy abdominal pain with positive Rovsing and Dunphy signs. Dengue infection was confirmed by a positive NS1 antigen test performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An abdominal ultrasound revealed an appendicular process; as the abdominal pain in the right side kept increasing, an open appendectomy was performed. Abundant inflammatory liquid was observed during the surgery, and the pathology laboratory reported an oedematous appendix with fibrinopurulent plaques, which agreed with acute ulcerative appendicitis. The patient was discharged fully recovered without complications during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Acute abdominal pain can be caused in some cases by dengue infection. This can be confusing, which can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, creating additional morbidities and costs for the patient. This unusual and coincident acute appendicitis with dengue highlights the importance of performing careful clinical studies for appropriate decision making, especially in dengue endemic regions during an outbreak of this disease.",0,1634
1,"A 21 year-old man, HIV infected, and with poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment, consulted us due to a papular rash on trunk and extremities, showing simultaneously hypochromic stains on his back. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. In the mycological study of the clinical samples taken from different lesions, yeasts compatible with Malassezia were observed. Oral itraconazole was prescribed, with an excellent clinical response. Finding the same etiolologic agent in 2different clinical pictures on a single patient is extremely rare.",0,550
2,"BACKGROUND: Keratomycosis is one of the most prevalent ophthalmic infections, which needs a specific treatment depending on the nature of the infecting fungus. The prognosis is usually severe and depends on an early diagnosis and suitable therapy. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of keratitis due to Fusarium solani in a patient from a rural area, who, between May and October 2011, suffered a corneal trauma caused by dust particles in Valdivia, Chile. On two occasions, direct examination of eye scrapes revealed abundant septate hyphae. All cultures were positive for the same fungus, which was identified as Fusarium solani by phenotypic characterization and sequencing of ribosomal nuclear genes. The patient was initially treated with amphotericin B and afterwards successfully responded to a treatment with oral and intravenous voriconazole, although corneal opacity persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Although keratomycosis in Chile is rare, its diagnostic particularities must be taken into consideration to establish the most effective treatment. Thus, a rapid visualization of the fungus in the lesion, an efficient isolation of the etiologic agent in pure culture is essential, as well as its rapid identification, which requires the use of molecular sequencing techniques in the case of Fusarium species.",0,1306
3,"Congenital toxoplasmosis continues to be a public health threat. Even existing guidelines, publicly known, its implementation and lack of appropriate interpretation of serological tests in pregnancy is often observed. This leds to failure in opportunities for positive and known interventions to decrease the fetal risk due to Toxoplasma gondii infection. We reported herein a case series, with variable neurological and systemic compromise (respiratory distress, hepatosplenomegaly, enterocolitis, brain calcifications, thrombocytopenia, ascites, shock), even fatal, calling for awareness about the fact that despite the Zika epidemics in 2015-2016 in Brazil, Colombia and other countries, precisely toxoplasmosis, is a differential diagnosis still prevalent in these territories, that can leds to severe consequences, with neurological disability and risk of ocular damage, even lately. Additionally, with varieties of T. gondii with more aggressive patterns in Latin America, which make worse those cases, including also a higher risk of death.",0,1047
4,"The incidence of prosthetic shoulder replacements has increased considerably in recent years, as well as the complications derived from the procedure. The correct diagnosis of each type of complication is essential for therapeutic decision making, which is currently based on the information provided by radiological and nuclear medicine imaging. Nevertheless, both techniques have intrinsic limitations that could be mostly overcome with the advent of the hybrid SPECT/CT imaging, which is set to play a fundamental role in the evaluation of shoulder prostheses.",0,563
5,"Pulmonary hypertension associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection is an extremely rare disease in pediatrics; it requires a high clinical suspicion to reach a diagnosis. Its appearance poses an unfavorable prognostic, but early diagnosis and specific treatment can improve outcomes. We report the clinical case of a fifteen-year-old patient diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus infection of vertical transmission, without antiretroviral treatment, with cough and progressive exertional dyspnea, associated with signs of right heart failure in which severe pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed. After discarding other causes, it was assumed pulmonary hypertension associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Treatment was performed with sildenafil with good response.",0,797
6,"CLINICAL CASE: An 82-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department complaining of a sudden painless visual loss in his left eye (OS). He was diagnosed with branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) with a visible embolus. In 2012, he had a central artery occlusion (CRAO) in his right eye (OD). An embolysis with Nd:YAG laser was attempted, the retinal arterial blood flow was restored completely and the visual field was improved, with no secondary complications. CONCLUSIONS: Nd:YAG laser embolysis is a treatment to be considered in patients with BRAO with a visible embolus. The risks and benefits of the procedure should be evaluated, comparing it with possible permanent loss of visual acuity and other vascular complications caused by BRAO.",0,752
7,"Radiologic findings of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a novel coronavirus infection, have been rarely reported. We report a 30-year-old male presented with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, who was diagnosed with MERS. A chest computed tomographic scan revealed rapidly developed multifocal nodular consolidations with ground-glass opacity halo and mixed consolidation, mainly in the dependent and peripheral areas. After treatment, follow-up imaging showed that these abnormalities markedly decreased but fibrotic changes developed.",1,546
8,"Bacterial superinfection is a known complication among patients affected by viral respiratory tract infections. Streptococcus pyogenes, a major bacterial agent involved in acute tonsillopharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections, was reported as a co-infecting microorganism during the 2009 A H1N1 influenza pandemic. We report a 65-year-old male patient who evolved with multifocal pneumonia and multiple organ failure with a fatal outcome. Influenza A H1N1 was detected by a polymerase chain reaction-based technique from a tracheal aspirate sample. S. pyogenes was identified by a rapid test from a nasopharyngeal sample and isolated afterwards from a positive blood culture.",0,680
9,"BACKGROUND: The appendix inflammatory process is the most common cause of chronic abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. The frequency of appendiceal lumen obstruction by fecalith ranges from 10 to 20%; few cases of obstruction by multiple fecaliths had been reported. CLINICAL CASE: Sixty-nine years old male, diabetic and hypertensive in control, he underwent bowel resection 30 years previously. He completed 6 months with intermittent, mild pain in the right lower quadrant abdomen; 14 days prior to admission with increasing pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension and absence of peristalsis; 12,750 leukocytes, neutrophils 90%; plain abdominal radiography without specific bowel pattern, TAC with 3 dense images in right lower quadrant; exploratory laparotomy was performed and perforated appendix with 3 free fecaliths was found. Histopathological report showed fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate in the muscle layer of the cecal appendix consistent with chronic appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS: The most common obstruction of the appendix lumen is by a single fecalith. In this case the patient had chronic appendicitis secondary to appendiceal lumen obstruction by multiple fecaliths. Reviewing the international literature any case of chronic appendicitis associated with the presence of multiple fecaliths was found.",0,1346
10,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 46-year-old male with right eye proptosis and conjunctival hyperaemia, of 18 months onset. A well-defined intraconal mass was found in the computed tomography. In magnetic resonance this was hypo-intense on T1, enhanced with gadolinium and hyperintense on T2. Excisional biopsy was performed, which was reported as a well-differentiated liposarcoma in the histopathology study. DISCUSSION: Liposarcoma is a malignant adipose tissue tumour. It is very rare in the orbit, with 5 histological types, the most common being myxoid. The treatment of choice is wide surgical excision and may be accompanied with radiotherapy. As it is an infiltrative tumour, It has a high rate of recurrence.",0,725
11,"Vasculitic midline destructive lesions can be a complication of cocaine use. We report a 44-year-old man who presented with a two months history of left facial pain associated with ipsilateral facial paralysis and a cheek phlegmon. Magnetic resonance imaging showed broad soft tissue destruction linked to important cranial nerve involvement. Antibiotic and antifungal therapy was started and multiple surgical debridement procedures were performed, with no clinical improvement. Microbiological analysis was negative. Finally, thanks to the histologic findings corresponding to vasculitis and granuloma formation and the history of cocaine abuse, a cocaine induced midline destructive lesion was diagnosed.",0,707
12,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome should be considered in patients with cerebellar lesions who also suffer cognitive deficits associated with visuospatial or executive neuropsychological disorders, expressive language disorders and affective disorders. CLINICAL CASE: A 16 year old adolescent diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 7 presents with emotional instability, apathy, and speech and reading difficulties. Neuropsychological tests show visuospatial difficulties. A brain magnetic resonance imaging is performed due to impaired coordination and fine motor movements and shows atrophy of the cerebellar vermis. The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome. The cerebellum is mostly known for its motor role. However, it is also involved in higher cognitive functions, expression of emotion and behavioral regulation. Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome is a relatively unknown diagnosis and should be included in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders with cerebellar lesion.",0,1113
13,"Hyperthyroidism is defined as an excessive production of thyroid hormones by eutopic or ectopic mature thyroid tissue. The overall prevalence of hyperthyroidism is 1.2% and the most common cause is Graves' disease. Struma ovarii represents 1% of all ovarian tumors and is an uncommon cause of ectopic hyperthyroidism. It is benign in >90% of the cases; usually asymptomatic, and only 8% are presented with thyrotoxicosis, being rare its association with Graves' disease. We report the case of a patient with this association.",0,525
14,"In a patient with a differentiated thyroid cancer the standard treatment protocol to be followed is surgery, ablation of thyroid remnants with (131)Iodine ((131)I), and TSH suppression. However, the treatment with (131)I is not effective in some cases, and it no longer becomes a therapeutic option due to cell de-differentiation with loss of (131)I uptake. Systemic treatment can be used as other options, although patients are not always responsive; thus, the disease may progress and therapeutic options may run out. Endocrine tumours may express somatostatin receptors,and this characteristic has been used, not only for diagnosis, but also for their treatment through somatostatin analogue labelling with radioactive isotopes. This was the case of a patient suffering from iodine-refractory follicular thyroid carcinoma, with somatostatin receptors expression, treated with (177)Lu-DOTATATE, showing an excellent clinical and analytical response.",0,951
15,"Acute transverse myelitis is defined as an acquired neuroimmune disorder of the spinal cord, which occurs as a consequence of a primary event, or directly related to an autoimmune inflammatory disease, an infectious or post-infectious disease. Amongst infectious etiologies, Borrelia spp., a tick-bourne anthropozoonosis of the ixodidae family, prevails. Approximately 10 to 15% of patients with Lyme disease undergo neurologic manifestations, with an assorted and uncertain array of clinical syndromes. Transverse myelitis accounts for up to 5% of Lyme neuroborreliosis. We describe the case of a traveler from endemic zone for Lyme disease, with encephalomyelitis secondary to acute infection by Borrelia burgderfori, with complete resolution of symptoms after concluding adequate antibiotic treatment.",0,804
16,"A case is presented of a protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a 17 year-old female patient, who presented with ascites, edema and hypoalbuminemia. The diagnosis of SLE was based on the presence of: malar rash, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, antinuclear antibodies, IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant. Renal and liver diseases were ruled out. The PLE diagnosis was confirmed with fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. The PLE was refractory to different lines of immunosuppressive agents like glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, showing a satisfactory and sustained response with rituximab, allowing steroid sparing and long term remission.",0,754
17,"BACKGROUND: Nutcracker syndrome is a rare entity, and in the majority of cases is the result of extrinsic compression of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, associated with functional stenosis. OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a 19-year-old female with no significant medical history with confirmed diagnosed of nutcracker syndrome treated successfully by endovascular means. CLINICAL CASE: She was referred to the Vascular Surgery Department with a 6-month history of macroscopic haematuria, after other aetiologies were ruled out. Abdominal computed tomography angiography revealed compression of the left renal vein; the patient underwent endovascular treatment, and a 12x16 mm balloon expandable stent was placed with immediate angiographic improvement, decreased pressure gradients and progressive resolution of haematuria. At one year, she remains symptom-free. CONCLUSION: Nutcracker syndrome is uncommon, and a high index of suspicion is needed. Macroscopic haematuria is not always present, and in our case stent placement demonstrated effectiveness in the resolution of symptoms at 12 months' follow--up. We also present a brief review of the literature.",0,1203
18,"BACKGROUND: Omental torsion is an infrequent cause of acute abdomen and its symptoms are non-specific, often presenting with pain at the right iliac fossa as the only symptom. Its aetiology remains unknown, but different risk factors have been associated with the disease, including obesity, congenital malformations, and tumours. These risk factors have been classified as predisposing or triggering, primary or secondary, and external or internal. CLINICAL CASE: The is a case of a 24-year-old male who complained about pain in the right iliac fossa without any other symptoms. The diagnosis was acute appendicitis, but during the laparoscopic approach, omental torsion was found. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of omental torsion is is complex. However, computed tomography and ultrasound have been used successfully. The treatment for omental torsion is the resection of necrotised tissue by a laparoscopic approach.",0,915
19,"BACKGROUND: Caecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction. Its clinical presentation is non-specific, with the diagnosis usually confirmed by barium enema and abdominal computed tomography. Treatment depends on many factors, and minimally invasive approaches are becoming the treatment of choice. CLINIC CASE: A 54 years old female, admitted to the Emergency Department with clinical symptoms of intestinal obstruction. On physical examination she had a palpable, firm, and tympanitic mass in the right abdomen, with peritoneal irritation. The radiographs of the abdomen, barium enema and abdominal computed tomography showed caecal volvulus. As she showed a full remission after the barium enema, with no clinical or biochemical data of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or peritoneal irritation, she was discharged to her home. Two weeks later, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed with an ileo-transverse extracorporeal anastomosis. Her progress was satisfactory, and she was discharged 4 days after surgery due to improvement. CONCLUSION: Caecal volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, with high mortality rates, and is caused by excessive mobility of the caecum. Its incidence is increasing. Treatment depends on many factors. Early non-surgical untwisting, followed by an elective laparoscopic surgical procedure offers several advantages and reduces mortality.",0,1414
20,"The co-existence of a double chromosomal abnormality in one individual is a rare event, even more the simultaneous presence of Klinefelter (XXY) and Edwards (trisomy 18) syndrome. The aim of this article is to report the case of a newborn with a double aneuploidy, which consists in the coexistence of Edwards and Klinefelter syndrome. The patient's phenotype correlates mainly with Edwards syndrome. The diagnosis is made by performing the cytogenetics (karyotype) of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Only 15 cases of patients with Klinefelter and Edwards syndromes had been reported in literature so far.",0,603
21,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to prenatally exposure to citalopram can develop during the first days of life even with low dose of drug exposure. Supportive management is the first choice but phenobarbital can be used in treatment of this syndrome. Breastfeeding should not be interrupted. These neonates should be followed both for NAS and neurodevelopmental outcome. In this article, we reported a newborn with NAS due to citalopram exposure with a lower dose than previously reported in the literature, during the last six months of pregnancy. Phenobarbital was used because of non-pharmacological treatment failure.",0,628
22,"INTRODUCTION: Cluster headache is a rare cause of primary headache in children. We report four cases with a mean age of onset of 8.6, ranged from 2 to 13 years. CASE REPORTS: Three males and one female with onset at 2, 7, 13, and 12 years-old, respectively, were included. The symptoms of all patients fulfill the criteria for the diagnosis of cluster headache according to the International Society of Headache. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being rare during childhood, cluster headache should be part of the differential diagnosis of headache in childhood. This report highlights the variable features of this disorder in children, often misdiagnosed. It can be useful in making a quick diagnosis and starting the appropriate treatment early. Verapamil was more effective than flunarizine in terminating the headache in our patients. Oxygen treatment and triptans resulted the treatments with the best response in acute cluster headache.",0,931
23,"CLINICAL CASE: A 58-year-old woman with intraocular relapse of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Weekly intravitreal rituximab (1 mg/0.1 ml) for 4 weeks were administered. 12 months after the last intravitreal rituximab dose, signs and symptoms of lymphomas or adverse reactions associated with intravitreal Rituximab administration were not observed. DISCUSSION: Intravitreal rituximab is an effective and safe treatment of intravitreal lymphoma, by inducing complete remission; it could be a good alternative to other therapeutic options with greater number of serious complications.",0,584
24,"Pulmonary involvement in the form of acute pneumonitis in adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an uncommon manifestation, with few cases reported in the literature. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with 3 years of AOSD evolution, treated with methotrexate (MTX) and half-dose corticosteroids, which debuted with symptoms of fever, dyspnea and dry cough after 3 weeks of receiving the first dose of tocilizumab (TCZ). In the follow-up study showed leukocytosis with left shift, elevated serum ferritin and C-reactive protein standard. The chest CT scan showed ground-glass pattern predominantly in central and upper lobes and the BAL shows an increase in the percentage of lymphocyte with normal subpopulations and negative cultures. MTX and TCM were suspended, prednisone was increased to 30mg/day and within a week Anakinra 100mg/day SC was iniciated, noting in a few days a progressive clinical, analytical and radiological improvement.",0,947
25,"Anomalies of the origin of coronary arteries are detected in 0.5-1.5% of all angiographies. Anomalous origin of the left main trunk is the most uncommon and its origin from pulmonary artery in adults is exceptional, usually because it is associated with a short survival. We report a 49-year-old female, presenting with a two months history of angina. The exercise electrocardiogram suggested ischemia. A coronary angiography was performed, showing the absence of the left main trunk in the left coronary sinus, a dilated right coronary artery, with no lesions and extensive collateral circulation to the anterior descending and circumflex arteries, with inverted flow and the left main trunk draining to the pulmonary artery. The left ventricle was mildly dilated with middle and apical anterior hypokinesia. Global systolic function was conserved. A surgical correction was decided, occluding the left main anomalous origin and performing a coronary artery bypass grafting from the left internal thoracic artery. The patient was discharged with no complications. At two years of follow-up she is symptom free and has a normal physical capacity.",0,1146
26,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases have increased in recent years. Candida species are the most common aetiology. Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are the cause of most of them. The aim of this work is to describe the first isolation of Candida fabianii in the blood of a non-neonatal paediatric patient. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male with short bowel syndrome, severe malnutrition, and hypophosphataemic rickets deficiency was admitted to paediatric intensive care due to a respiratory tract infection and suspicion of an intestinal pseudo-obstruction. He received several cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics for several infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. After the surgical correction of the intestinal disorder he suffered a new episode of sepsis where yeasts were isolated by culture. The species identification was performed by means of mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF system, Bruker Daltonic). The identity of the isolate was C.fabianii (anamorph)/Pichia fabianii (teleomorph) with a score of 2.149. Antifungal treatment with caspofungin was prescribed, with good progress of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular techniques are important for the identification of these species, although mass spectrometry offered a reliable and rapid diagnosis. Treatment with caspofungin was effective.",0,1384
27,"We present a case of multiple lymphangiohemangiomas (hematolymphangiomas, hemangiolymphangiomas, or combined lymphatic venous malformation) with thoracic and abdominal involvement in an asymptomatic patient. We describe and illustrate the imaging findings in this disease, which are quite characteristic and can enable an accurate diagnosis. To our knowledge, there are no other reports of similar cases in the scientific literature.",0,433
28,"OBJECTIVES: To present to report the first case of ureteral lithiasis resolved using a new endoscopic approach, which we call microureteroscopy (m-URS) and attempts to reduce the ureteral damage caused by conventional instrumentation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected a 53-year-old patient with a 16-mm calculus in the right distal ureter. For endoscopic access, we used a 4.8 Fr sheath from the microperc set and fragmented the stone with a 230-micron laser fiber. RESULTS: Complete fragmentation of the stone was achieved. We placed a JJ catheter due to significant ureteral edema. The surgical time and postsurgical stay were 156minutes and 24hours, respectively. There were no complications, the requirements for analgesia were minimal, and the patient was free of residual stones. CONCLUSIONS: The m-URS technique is feasible, simple and effective for the treatment of pelvic ureteral lithiasis in women and optimizes minimal invasion, with results that can be comparable to conventional endoscopic techniques in terms of ease of access and quality of endoscopic vision without affecting the resolution capacity. Larger studies and greater technological development is needed to define the definitive role of this procedure. Currently, its major limitations lie in the treatment of proximal ureter lithiasis and in the treatment of men. This technique could also be a viable alternative for pediatric patients.",0,1416
29,"INTRODUCTION: The celiac disease is an autoimmune bowel disease trigger by gliadine proteins, that can has systemic involvement with varied neurological manifestation since polineuropathy, ataxia, epilepsy, migraine to encephalitis. The aim of the current work is to report a case of possible refractory encephalitis due to celiac disease. CASE REPORT: A 45 years-old man with histopathologic diagnosis of celiac disease but negative celiac antibodies developed encephalic, brainstem and periphery nervous system manifestations: cognitive declaim and seizures, diplopia and ataxia, polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy respectively; inflammatory cebrospinal fluid and cortico-subcortical and multiple brainstem lesions with mild contrast enhancement; the neurologic deficits progress in spite of gluten a free diet and immuno-suppressive treatment. During the illness process some pathologies with nervous system and intestinal involvement were discarded: sarcoidosis, systemic lupus; Sjogren syndrome, paraneoplastic syndromes, Whipple disease, AIDS and B12 vitamin deficit. CONCLUSION: The encephalitis is an infrequent clinical manifestation of the celiac disease despite the high prevalence of the celiac disease in the general population. It presents with numerous differential diagnosis, with requires high suspicious diagnosis.",0,1334
30,"Cleidocranial dysplasia is an uncommon bone dysplasia with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern characterized by short stature, large fontanels, midface hypoplasia, absence or hypoplasia of clavicles and orodental alterations. This is Estudio clinico y molecular en una familia con displasia cleidocraneal Clinical and molecular study in a family with cleidocranial dysplasia produced by mutations in the RUNX2 gene located at 6p21.1. We report two male adolescents (cousins), with cleidocranial dysplasia who presented a heterozygous missense mutation (c.674G> A, p.R225Q) in the RUNX2 gene, characterized by severe phenotype, such as absent clavicles, but with variation in the delayed fontanel closure, dental abnormalities (anomalies in shape and number) and scoliosis, thus demonstrating intrafamilial variation in these patients with the same genotype.",0,863
31,"INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an infrequent disorder that produces focal or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. It can be idiopathic or secondary to infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic processes. The recently described 'IgG4-related disease' could be the cause of many cases considered cryptogenic. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old woman, with a history of bronchial asthma, presented with headache, dizziness and hearing loss on her left ear. The brain MRI study with gadolinium showed enhancement and thickening of the dura mater, extending from lateral wall of left cavernous sinus and medial temporal lobe to cerebellopontine angle and ipsilateral tentorium. CSF had 10 leukocytes/microL (90% mononuclear), with 1 g/L protein and without glucose consumption. Pathology showed fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with 16 IgG4+ plasma cells per high power field. The rest of analytical and microbiological studies were normal or negative. The plasma IgG4 rate was within normal limits. After treatment with steroids there was clinical improvement accompanied by the virtual disappearance of the alterations detected in neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease can be diagnosed based on MRI findings if plasma IgG4 is elevated. In doubtful cases we must resort to meningeal biopsy. Corticosteroid therapy is usually effective and it is the first line treatment.",0,1440
32,"BACKGROUND: Tracheal bronchus is considered a rare, congenital anomaly, which implies the abnormal origin of a bronchus. When related to repetitive infections the bronchus must be resected, usually via an open procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to present the case of a patient with tracheal bronchus of the upper right lobe who presented with repetitive pneumonias. Additionally, this text intends to expose the methodology for its diagnosis and surgical resolution through a thoracoscopic lobectomy. CLINICAL CASE: One year old female patient who presented with the disorder at two months of age. The patient presented with constant coughing and persistent fever alongside repetitive pneumonias in the upper right lobe. In order to discard the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux, a bronchoscopy and a panendoscopy of the digestive tube were conducted. The aforesaid procedure demonstrated the existence of a tracheal bronchus located in the right lobe, with functional bronchial segmentation. With these findings and due to the presence of repetitive infections, an apical right lobectomy was performed through a thoracoscopy, with favourable results. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheal bronchus is a rare anomaly that on many occasions is asymptomatic; nonetheless, when related to repetitive infections, a lobectomy must be carried out to avoid further pulmonary damage. This can be done through a thoracoscopy, as was the case with our patient. When treating these patients, it is worth considering they tend to have a different anatomy and to consider the ease at which they can sustain severe inflammation due to repetitive infections.",0,1645
33,"The use of ultrasound imaging has recently been increasing in numerous dermatologic diseases. This noninvasive technique provides additional details on the structure and vascularization of skin lesions. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that typically arises in the skin and mucosas. It can spread to lymph nodes and internal organs. We performed B-mode and color Doppler ultrasound studies in 3 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma confirmed by histological examination. We found differences in the ultrasound pattern between nodular and plaque lesions, in both B-mode and color Doppler. We believe that skin ultrasound imaging could be a useful technique for studying cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma, providing additional information on the structural and vascular characteristics of the lesion.",0,807
34,"Low back pain during pregnancy is a common cause of medical consultation. Although back pain is very common, the incidence of low back pain secondary to lumbar disk herniation in pregnancy is low (1: 10,000). Cauda equina syndrome from lumbar disk herniation is a serious complication. The delay in diagnosis and treatment can be a cause of chronic disability secondary to neurological sequelae. Numerous cases of disk herniation in pregnancy have been reported, however the association of a cauda equina syndrome as a result of disk herniation is rare. A case is presented of cauda equina syndrome in a pregnant woman at 12-week gestation.",0,640
35,"The appearance of a subdural hygroma after the rupture of an arachnoid cyst wall is extremely rare, with very few cases described in the literature. Most cases are due to a traumatic cause. The therapeutic approach in symptomatic cases is controversial, with a current tendency toward conservative management initially. In those cases that require surgical treatment, multiple therapeutic options are available, with fenestration techniques being recommended as first-line treatment. We describe 2cases treated in our centre and review the literature.",0,551
36,"The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a causative agent of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) is unusual and its clinical interpretation is difficult. We describe here three cases of SSTI due to S. pneumoniae in patients admitted to the Provincial Pediatric Hospital of Misiones, Argentina that were detected during 10 years of invasive disease (ID) surveillance documented in 2010, 2011 and 2015. These cases involved two girls aged 8 and 7 months old, and a two-year-old male child with diagnoses of gluteal abscess, preseptal cellulites and pyoderma respectively. All the patients were eutrophic and in good general condition on admission; one of them was seropositive for HIV. Antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes were framed within the local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease. Despite its low frequency, S. pneumoniae as an etiological agent of SSTI must be considered. Our findings revalue the role of the diagnostic laboratory and contribute to document the behavior of this pathogen.",0,1015
37,"Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a systemic disease included in the Chapel Hill 2012 Classification as necrotizing vasculitis affecting capillaries, venules and arterioles. It usually expresses antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and has a perinuclear immunofluorescence pattern and correlation with anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies. Capillaritis with alveolar hemorrhage is the most common manifestation of lung disease. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is uncommon, with usual interstitial pneumonia being the predominant pattern. However, other patterns such as organizing pneumonia have been described. No guidelines exist for treating patients with ILD and, currently, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is managed along the lines of small vessel vasculitis. The prognosis with this association is uncertain, with possibilities of relapse and a fatal outcome. We present a case in which ILD was the first manifestation of MPA, without alveolar hemorrhage, with subsequent renal involvement and, in which, the established treatment produced a significant clinical improvement.",0,1092
38,"BACKGROUND: Splenic abscesses are rare entities; reports are commonly described in immunocompromised patients (72%) as: hematologic diseases, diabetes, endocarditis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, transplant patients and subjects who had abdominal trauma or splenic infarction. The main and most serious complication is the abscess rupture into the peritoneal cavity or adjacent organs (stomach or colon), which determines hemodynamic instability or septic state. CLINICAL CASE: Fifty-year-old man, who was admitted at Emergency Room due eight days' progressive, oppressive, and current pain; intensity 4/10, irradiated at hemi-back, which was higher intensity during the standing and decreased at supine position. It was accompanied by nausea and vomiting in two occasions. LABORATORY RESULTS: Hemoglobin 15.1g/dl, hematocrit 45.2%, platelets 176x10(3), 23.1x10(3) leukocytosis, neutrophils 92%. Simple abdominal radiographic studies revealed in 'ground glass' and radiopaque imagines. CONCLUSIONS: At presence of free air inside the abdominal cavity, is usually to think of a complicated diverticular disease, intestinal perforation or perforated peptic ulcer. The actual medical literature described very few cases of splenic abscess with pneumoperitoneum as cardinal manifestation. In our case, the splenic abscess was detected during exploratory laparotomy and only in retrospective the imaging studies were interpreted.",0,1430
39,"INTRODUCTION: Contralateral sensorineural hearing loss (CSNHL) after vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a severe complication, especially in those cases in which hearing preservation in the operated side was not possible. There are several theories that attempt to explain this issue, but there is no established guideline of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report 4 patients treated in our institution who developed a severe CSNHL after surgery. RESULTS: Of the 185 cases of VS treated with surgery, 4 patients (2.2%) developed a CSNHL after VS surgery. After medical treatment, partial recovery of hearing occurred in one patient the other 3 patients presented a well-established severe SNHL. CONCLUSIONS: Established treatment guidelines do not exist, but the use of high doses of corticosteroids has been recommended and cochlear implant in cases with no recovery and complete hearing loss may be useful.",0,907
40,"INTRODUCTION: Mycotic infections due to Aspergillus spp, are the main mycotic associated infections in liver transplant patients, with mortality rates up to 90% of the cases. Almost 50% of patients will de velop an infection during the first months after transplantation, of which 10% are associated with op portunistic agents. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnosis and management of an Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) episode in a liver transplant patient. CASE REPORT: 11-months-old patient with liver transplant due to a biliary atresia who developed severe pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed high levels of galactomannan and positive culture for Aspergillus fumigatus leading to an IPA diagnosis. This episode was treated with antifungal with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: The IPA is an opportunistic infection in liver transplant patients, with high mortality rates, that must be suspected in this group of patients since an early diagnosis and treatment reduce mortality.",0,1035
41,"Immune encephalitis is a diverse group of disorders that share some unique diagnostic approaches and specific treatments. Some of the initial manifestations are non-specific and difficult to distinguish from encephalitis of other aetiologies, and even with modern diagnostic tools there are still a number of cases for which definitive causes cannot be clarified. Among these, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a particular form of immune encephalitis that has some distinctive clinical manifestations, which allows the clinical evaluator to suggest a more accurate diagnosis and start treatments even in the absence of specific laboratory tests. Three paediatric patients, who were treated for NMDAR encephalitis are described in this article, as well as comparing their clinical presentation. This specific disorder and some of the more relevant features of its physiopathology are reviewed in order to explain the initial psychiatric manifestations, for which early recognition is critical for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",0,1056
42,"INTRODUCTION: Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a prevalent disease in certain tropical regions endemic for HTLV-1, being a rare entity in areas such as Europe and North America. CASE REPORTS: We report two new cases of HAM/TSP in Caucasians, native from Galicia, Spain. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, clinical neurophysiologic studies and brain and spinal cord MRI scans were performed. Both patients presented a progressive chronic myelopathy, evolving to spastic paraparesis; one of them presenting with uveitis, prior to the onset of neurological symptoms. CSF analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein concentration with positive anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for HTLV-1. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. In one of the patients, MRI scans did not reveal abnormalities whilst in the other there was an elongated high intensity lesion at the thoracic spinal cord level, which resolved after treatment. No evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found. Corticosteroids and interferon alpha therapy was started, with moderate functional improvement. A history of unprotected sexual relationships while travelling to HTLV-1 endemic areas was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1-associated uveitis may predict HAM/TSP. HAM/TSP is probably an underdiagnosed disease due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, insidious clinical presentation and low suspicion index in non-endemic regions for HTLV-1. In non-tropical countries, HAM/TSP should not only be suspected in migrants from endemic areas for HTLV-1, but also in patients from communities with a tradition of migration to tropical countries.",0,1744
43,"Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem. Cutaneous involvement is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis infection. Sporotrichoid clinical pattern consists of a linear arrangement of nodules along the lymphatic vessels. It is often seen in sporotrichosis. Few cases have been reported of cutaneous tuberculosis presenting as a sporotrichoid clinical pattern. We describe a 84-year-old female with ulcerative nodules on upper extremity caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, emphasizing the importance of considering cutaneous tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of sporotrichoid lesions.",0,602
44,"BACKGROUND: Benign multicystic mesothelioma is a rare benign tumour derived from the peritoneal mesothelium. The aim of this paper is to present a case of this rare tumour and review the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of this disease. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 22-year-old female diagnosed with multicystic mesothelioma after an urgent resection of intra-abdominal tumour in the context of acute abdominal pain. In the subsequent follow-up, the patient had a recurrence of the lesion, and at 2 years was treated by further resection. CONCLUSIONS: Benign multicystic mesothelioma is a benign tumour of unknown origin, and with a non-specific clinical manifestation. The most effective treatment is surgical, although there is a high tendency to local recurrence.",0,789
45,"BACKGROUND: Splenic abscess is a rare clinic entity, its incidence has increased due to the rising number of clinical conditions involving immunosuppression. Endocarditis is the most frequent cause, and gram-positive aerobes are the main causal agents. Its clinical presentation is non-specific and delays diagnosis. Computed tomography scan is the method of choice, and the treatment is based on antibiotics and drainage, radiological or surgical, involving splenectomy in special cases that require it. CLINICAL CASE: A 55-year-old man with abdominal pain and fever. The analysis revealed leukocytosis 14,000/mm3, prothrombin activity 53%, and metabolic acidosis. Computed tomography scan showed a peri-hepatic pneumoperitoneum, liquid fluid, and peri-splenic bubbles, and slight trabeculation of fat around the duodenal bulb with pneumoperitoneum in this area. Patient underwent a median laparotomy, finding a purulent peritonitis due to a ruptured abscess in the spleen, splenectomy was performed. Fluid culture showed polymorphonuclears, with no microorganisms identified. The patient progressed and was discharged on the 5th post-operative day. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic abscess is an uncommon condition, in which the diagnosis is delayed and mortality, in untreated patients, is high. Its association with pneumoperitoneum may confuse the diagnosis towards viscera perforation. Thus it must be suspected in the finding of unknown cause of pneumoperitoneum by complementary examinations. The treatment of choice is splenectomy, because the capsular rupture is the norm in all of them.",0,1585
46,"INTRODUCTION: Dandy Walker variant is defined by a variable hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermix with or without posterior fossa increase and without tentorium elevation. OBJECTIVE: describe the case of a rare disease and emphasise the need to clarify the aetiology of prenatal malformations, as well as its multidisciplinary management. CASE REPORT: A male patient, 8 years of age, with a history of Infantile Cerebral Palsy and epilepsy, who was admitted with a history of tonic-clonic seizures. He was admitted due to psycho-motor developmental delay. During his hospitalisation, he had multiple seizure episodes, controlled with anticonvulsants. A computerized tomography was performed, in which communication was observed between the cisterna magna and fourth ventricle (the latter increased in size). In addition, the cerebellar vermix showed a partial hypoplasia. All these findings were compatible with a variant of the Dandy Walker syndrome. CONCLUSION: Dandy Walker variant may be asymptomatic and the images found may not indicate them as the cause of developmental disorders, due to its association with multiple syndromes and chromosomal abnormalities. Clinical presentation and prognosis depends on the related disorders, and a multidisciplinary approach is important, because the treatment depends on the symptoms presented.",0,1338
47,"Accidents caused by urticating or poisonous setae from lepidoptera caterpillars are known as erucism. These accidents are produced by accidental contact, especially in children, with bristles on the insect's body surface, connected to venom glands. Symptoms may be local or systemic, with deadly clinical presentations. The accident caused by Lonomia spp. caterpillars can trigger bleeding disorders, which is considered the most severe type of erucism. The case of a 5-year-old girl is reported. She was from the town of Villarondos, in the Peruvian Amazon, department of Huanuco, who accidentally knelt down on caterpillar bristles, and subsequently experienced hemolytic anemia, plateletopenia, and coagulation disorder. The diagnosis was made based on the medical history, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination results, and response to antilonomic serum. The clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic aspects of erucism due to Lonomia spp. are discussed.",0,963
48,"AIM: Chronic constipation is a common pathology in children. The aim of this paper was to show the usefulness of gastrointestinal transit scintigraphy in pediatric patients with chronic constipation, and the advantages with respect to other imaging techniques, despite our limited experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 5 patients sent to our service with a diagnosis of chronic constipation refractory to treatment. We performed a complete study protocol, including liquid gastric emptying scintigraphy and small and large bowel transit times, using a single dose of (111)In-DTPA. Following international guidelines regions of interest were defined in stomach, terminal ileum and in 6 regions of the large intestine. RESULTS: All patients showed altered scintigraphy study, showing 4 of them normal radiological tests. Radioisotopic study changed diagnosis in 2 patients and in other 2 patients contributed to clarify it, since discordance between normal radiological tests and abnormal rectal biopsy. One of the patients showed concordance between each imaging modality. The results of the test changed the therapeutic management in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited experience coincides with published data in which scintigraphy study turns out to be a reproducible and accurate method. It provides physiological, quantitative and useful information in the study of constipation, being the unique exploration that allows both global and regional gastrointestinal transit time determination.",0,1501
49,"Susac syndrome is a rare disorder caused by autoimmune-mediated occlusions of microvessels in the brain, retina and inner ear. These occlusions lead to a characteristic clinical triad of central nervous system dysfunction, visual disturbances and vestibule-cochlear deficits. The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and complementary studies, which demonstrate the involvement of three systems. There are different treatments that include various immunosuppressive drugs combinations such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, among others. We present the case of a 26-year-old woman with left hearing loss, tinnitus and episodes of recurrent vertigo, four weeks after bilateral blurred vision, cerebellar ataxia and encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple rounded hyperintense lesions in t2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), hypointense in t1, at the middle level of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, cerebellum and right middle cerebellar peduncle. The audiometry evidenced bilateral perceptual hearing loss, predominantly in the left ear. Angiography by optical coherence tomography showed obstruction in the deep layer retina arteries. The Susac syndrome was diagnosed and treatment started with methylprednisolone pulses therapy, intravenously 1000 mg/day for 5 days, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate, which completely reversed the encephalopathy, with persistence of mild ataxia and hearing loss. It is important to know the clinical triad characteristic and the complementary studies necessary to arrive at the diagnosis, since immunosuppressive treatment can often be delayed. Our case had an excellent response to corticosteroids.",0,1744
50,"BACKGROUND: Dematiaceous fungal genus Curvularia is a causal agent of keratitis, onychomycosis, and skin infections. In 2014, using DNA sequencing techniques, five new species, including Curvularia hominis, were described. In this article, a report is presented on the first clinical case of C.hominis infection in Spain. It concerns a corneal ulcer caused by this recently described species. CASE REPORT: A 46 year-old male patient with a corneal ulcer in his left eye went to the Emergency Department. Specimens were obtained from the lesion, and the patient was admitted due to the risk of corneal perforation. The fungal culture of the specimens revealed a filamentous fungus that was identified by microscopic examination as Curvulariaspp. Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) the isolate was identified as Curvularia lunata. To confirm the identification, the isolate was sent to the National Centre of Microbiology in Spain, where ITS region sequencing was performed, and it was finally identified as C.hominis. The patient received voriconazole and progressed favourably. To repair the corneal damage, the patient received an amniotic membrane transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: C.hominis should be considered a causal agent of keratitis and sequencing techniques are now necessary for species-level identification of Curvularia isolates. This is the first case report in Spain caused by this species.",0,1403
51,CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 73-year-old male patient who referred to having black and white vision. Computed tomography showed normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Magnetic resonance imaging was not performed because the patient refused to undergo further examinations. DISCUSSION: Achromatopsia may be the first or only NPH symptom. It may be prudent to ask patients with NPH regarding colour vision.,0,415
52,"Traumatic intracranial aneurysms (AICT) are rare and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. AICT are the result of head injuries caused by accidents, explosions, and gunfire. The case is reported here of a 28 year old man who was admitted to our hospital after suffering a penetrating head injury caused by a bullet. Radiographic studies showed interhemispheric subarachnoid haemorrhage and a likely AICT image that initially went unnoticed. One week later he underwent a cerebral angiography which showed a bilateral vasospasm of the terminal portion of the internal carotid and the appearance of a 2mm fusiform AICT at the orbit-frontal branch of the anterior cerebral artery. This was surgically treated after an aneurismal growth of 3.4mm and failure of the endovascular treatment. The patient showed a favourable outcome after surgery.",0,851
53,"Coarctation of the aorta, repaired in childhood, is a congenital heart disease frequently seen in adulthood. In these patients there is a higher incidence of hypertension during daily activities and exercise despite a correct surgical repair. Since hypertension may only be seen by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (occult arterial hypertension) we should also look for indirect signs, such as the development of left ventricular hypertrophy.",0,446
54,"POEMS syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation associated with hematopoietic disorders such as multiple myeloma and Castleman disease. POEMS is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome, namely, Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, and Skin abnormalities. Glomeruloid hemangiomas are considered to be a specific clinical marker of POEMS syndrome. However, while they are not pathognomonic, their presence should raise suspicion of this syndrome or alert clinicians to its possible future development, as these lesions can appear years before the onset of the syndrome. We report the cases of 2 women with plasma cell dyscrasias and sudden onset of lesions with a vascular appearance and histologic findings consistent with glomeruloid hemangioma. Recognition of this vascular tumor is important for the early diagnosis of POEMS syndrome.",0,875
55,"Genetic variability related to the host immune system has been proposed as one of the most influential factors in the development of diseases caused by HPV. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 5-year-old child in whom chronic laryngeal papillomatosis, probably acquired vertically during labor, was detected. The diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis was confirmed with a biopsy after a first surgery to remove the papillomas. The Derkay classification system was used to assess the severity of papillomatosis. Biopsy genotyping was performed by demonstrating HPV-6. Later, HLA-DQA1 * 0505, -DQB1 * 0301, -DRB1 * 1101 alleles were homozygous for HLA allele typing. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to identify the most prevalent HLA alleles in the Latino population and their potential association with genetic susceptibility in Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.",0,876
56,"The most common site of CSF leakage is the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, and less commonly in the sphenoid sinus. Only 3-4% of CSF fistulas are spontaneous. The fourth case is presented of a CSF rhinorrhea due to a transclival meningocele, an extremely rare location for these lesions, and the surgical approach. The patient is a 39-year-old male with no history of trauma, and a recent history of watery rhinorrhe and meningitis. CT scan and MRI showed clival bone defect and trans-sphenoidal transclival meningocele. The defect was repaired by transclival trans-sphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach with good results. Despite the rarity of transclival meningocele, it is recommended to consider it in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous nasal fistulas. The endoscopic endonasal approach is a direct technique that provides satisfactory results in the resolution of CSF rhinorrhea.",0,899
57,"OBJECTIVE: Prosthetic late infection occurs in the second month after surgery in the context of haematogenous spread from another source. Prosthetic mycobacterial infection is a rare complication whose clinical management is not standardized. CASE: Patient of 77 years with no personal history except for diabetes and a prosthetic replacement of right knee with osteoarthritis three years ago. Patient goes to hospital emergency box for 6 months pain in the right knee with mechanical inflammatory signs but no fever associated. After their return within 5 days and clinical worsening is reporting growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in knee aspirate and antitubercular treatment is established for 9 months. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging studies also confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis spondylitis in the clinical context of the patients. After surgery, M. tuberculosis was again isolated from intraoperative samples and therefore the patient received another batch of treatment for 9 months. After a year of monitoring, the development was acceptable but few months later, the patient died for cardiovascular causes. In the literature review, 15 publications with a total of 17 clinical cases of prosthetic infection by M. tuberculosis were found from 1980 to 2014. CONCLUSIONS: Prosthetic tuberculous arthritis, although it is a rare presentation, it should be noted, especially in patients with predisposing conditions with a history of tuberculosis infection.",0,1475
58,"BACKGROUND: Orbital cellulitis is an infectious disease that is very common in pediatric patients, in which severe complications may develop. Etiological agents related to this disease are Haemophilus influenzae B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which correspond to 95% of cases. Moreover, Streptococcus beta hemolytic and anaerobic microorganisms may also be present corresponding to < 5% of the cases. We present an uncommon case of cellulitis complicated by sub-periosteal abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus). CASE REPORT: A 9-year-old male patient with a history of deficit disorder and hyperactivity since 5 years of age. His current condition started with erythema in the external edge of the right eye, increase in peri-orbicular volume with limitation of eyelid opening, progression to proptosis, pain with eye movements and conjunctival purulent discharge. Image studies reported subperiosteal abscess and preseptal right with extraocular cellulitis. The patient started with empirical antibiotic treatment, surgical drainage and culture of purulent material from which Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the implementation of vaccination schemes against H. influenza and S. pneumoniae since the 90s, the cases by these pathogens have decreased, causing new bacteria to take place as the cause of the infection. The importance of considering S. pyogenes as an etiology of orbital cellulitis is the rapid progression to abscess formation, and the few cases described in the literature.",0,1603
59,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia is a primary humoral immunodeficiency. It is a recessive X-linked disorder characterized by low or absent circulating mature B cells, hypo/agammaglobulinemia and no humoral response to immunizations due to mutations along chromosome X. It is characterized by severe, recurrent and difficult treatment infections. It is diagnosed in the first 6 months of life in children; the only sign of alarm is the absent or decreased size of tonsils and lymph nodes, but it is not always present. The main cornerstones of treatment are immunoglobulin replacement therapy to maintain serum levels above 500-700 mg/dl and infection control; this allows these patients to do their day-to-day activities. We report a 2 year old boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, with no history of interest, who presented with P. aeruginosa sepsis. He had an excellent clinical improvement without further important infections after intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy.",0,979
60,"Vascular prosthetic graft infection (VPGI) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. An early and accurate diagnosis is essential in order to give the most appropriate treatment. The case is presented of a 74 year old male subjected to an aortobifemoral bypass graft, with clinical suspicion of VPGI with inconclusive tests. Later on an (18)F-FDG PET/CT study showed a pathological uptake, suggestive of periprosthetic infection, as well as an incidental pulmonary lesion, suggestive of a primary neoplasm. A new (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a significant improvement in the uptake by the vascular graft after prolonged antibiotic treatment. (18)F-FDG is a promising tracer for detecting VPGI as the accumulated activated white cells at the infection site have a high demand for (18)F-FDG, and could help define the response to antibiotic treatment.",0,851
61,"The aim of our work is to promote the awareness about the development of sarcoidosis after antineoplastic therapy in order to avoid diagnostic errors with FDG-PET/CT findings. We report the observation of three women with breast, cervix and stomach treated cancers who developed a sarcoidosis after the end of anti-neoplastic therapy. The utility of FDG-PET/CT is in pinpointing the organs candidates for diagnostic biopsy and not distinguishing between the malignancy and granulomatous or inflammatory diseases.",0,512
62,"Congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels implies double discordance: atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial. We present cardiac magnetic resonance images from a 9-year-old girl with congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels, interventricular communication, and coarctation of the aorta who was treated with pulmonary artery banding, correction of coarctation, and posterior double switch. We also review the disease and the complications that should be evaluated after the surgical intervention.",0,529
63,"BACKGROUND: Mucinous colloid lung adenocarcinoma is an uncommon variant of lung carcinomas with similar features to tumours seen in the gastrointestinal tract. To distinguish between these tumours and other mucinous lung tumours, such as mucinous bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas and metastatic mucinous lesions could be difficult with small biopsy specimens from fine needle aspiration. CLINICAL CASE: The case is described of a 49-year-old female with history of dyspnoea and cough with bloody sputum and weight lose. Thorax axial computed tomography demonstrated a right lower lobe spiculated mass with calcifications. Transthoracic computed tomography- guided fine needle biopsy reported negative results, and the biopsy obtained with video-assisted thoracic surgery was useful for an adequate cytology report of a colloid variant of mucinous lung adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Video-assisted thoracic surgery is an appropriate option for obtaining a larger specimen in those cases where small biopsies are inconclusive for the diagnosis of thoracic pathologies such as malignant tumours.",0,1092
64,"CASE REPORT: The case concerns 64-year-old woman with visual acuity of 20/40 in the right eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed a grey, feathery corneal opacification with intraepithelial microcysts compatible with Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy (LECD). It was treated with epithelial debridements, contact lenses and mitomycin C, but the opacification recurred within months. The removal of limbus sector and autologous limbal transplantation (KLAT) were used successfully without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: After removal of damaged limbus, KLAT should be considered as a treatment option for asymmetric LECD when other treatments have failed.",0,644
65,"The finding of persistent hypercalcemia suggests doing other medical tests to find the cause. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is usually benign and it requires no treatment. It is important to do CASR gene sequencing to avoid unnecessary treatments. We report a 12-year-old child, asymptomatic, with calcemia between 11.4 and 12.2 mg/dl. His father and two brothers presented asymptomatic hypercalcemia. The blood test with magnesium, phosphorus, 25(OH)Vit D was normal, remarkable normal parathyroid hormone for the level of hypercalcemia. Urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was 0,11 mg/dl and 24-hour urinary calcium was 1,8 mg/kg per day. Abdominal and parathyroid ecography, long bone radiographs and densitometry were normal. Genetic study showed a mutation, c.1651A>G, in exon 6 of the calciumsensing receptor gene, confirmed in father and brothers, too.",0,863
66,"INTRODUCTION: Gliomas are characterized by a infiltrative pattern of growth, with cellular migration along the white matter fiber tracts, exophytic growth in low-grade gliomas has not been described yet. A case of hemispheric glioma with slow growing and an exophytic component is presented. CASE REPORT: 55 year-old male, with motor partial seizures. MRI shows a WHO grade II oligodendroglioma infiltrating the superior frontal gyrus with exophytic extension above the precentral gyrus. Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed for 23 years. Volumetric assessment of tumor progression revealed a growth rate of 0.5 mm per year. Surgical dissection revealed that the precentral gyrus was displaced inferiorly by the tumor, and a clear subarachnoid plane separated both structures. Functional areas were not identified within the exophytic component. Postoperative neurological deficits were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The growth rate in low-grade gliomas has been estimated between 4 and 6 mm per year. The tumor described here had a growth rate of 0.5 mm per year, far below this average. Preoperative identification of this exophytic growth pattern is of major significance for surgical planning. The exophytic tumor is amenable for a safe and complete resection as it is covered by the arachnoid and pial membranes of the cistern and the surrounding brain.",0,1368
67,"BACKGROUND: Aneurysm of the splenic artery is diagnosed when the diameter of the splenic artery is greater than 1cm. It occupies third place among abdominal aneurysms. It is more frequent in women (4:1). It is associated with trauma, haemodynamics and local hormonal effects during pregnancy, portal hypertension (including the Caroli syndrome), arterial degeneration, atherosclerosis, and liver transplantation. It is difficult to diagnose, and it generally presents as ruptured, thus once the diagnosis is made, the surgical approach is indicated due to its high mortality. CLINICAL CASE: Female of 66 years of age with a diagnosis of splenic artery aneurysm, with pulsing sensation at epigastric level of 8 months onset. On physical examination there is a palpable throbbing mass of 9 cm of diameter approximately, for which she was admitted. The computed tomography angiography with reconstruction showed three splenic aneurysms. Two were tied and the larger one was repaired by endo-aneurysmorrhaphy. DISCUSSION: Visceral aneurysms are extremely rare. They are currently increasing and are the third leading cause of cardiovascular death, as morbidity/mortality is high. The surgical treatment must be done selectively according to their size. Selection of the surgical techniques depends on the anatomic location and the need for revascularisation, the aetiology and the experience of the surgeon. CONCLUSION: A review has been presented on the advances in diagnostic, and management, concluding that the best is to preserve the spleen, and whatever the technique it must be performed by trained surgeons.",0,1611
68,"Diabetic ketoacidosis with mild hyperglycemia is a major complication of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Although its use is not approved for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the drug is often prescribed with the hope of optimizing metabolic control. We report a 20 years old female with hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes consulting for vomiting and abdominal pain. The patient had used canagliflozin during the two previous months. Laboratory showed a blood glucose of 200 mg/dl, a severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1) and ketonemia. The patient was successfully treated in the intensive care unit.",0,616
69,CASE REPORT: A 73 year-old woman with depression treated with escitalopram developed acute secondary angle closure glaucoma related to uveal effusion after duplicating the drug dose 3 days before. She evolved favorably once the antidepressant treatment was suspended and a new treatment with topical hypotensive therapy and oral prednisone was used. DISCUSSION: The uveal effusion syndrome associated to medicines is rare; it may be associated with acute myopic shift and acute angle closure glaucoma. The correct diagnosis and discontinuation of the drug lead to the resolution of this nosology.,0,596
70,"Unilateral congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is an extremely rare disease of the pulmo nary lymphatic vessels. OBJECTIVE: to present a case of CPL in a premature newborn. CLINICAL CASE: premature male newborn with severe respiratory failure at 2 hours of extrauterine life was treated with exogenous surfactant, catecholamines and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bullae and air trapping of the left lung; the histopathological study showed cystic dilation of the bronchoalveolar lymphatic channels. The diagnosis of secondary unilateral CPL was made. The clinical course up to 19 months of age was normal and the chest CT scan showed few emphysematous bullae. CONCLUSIONS: CPL must be one of the differential diagnoses in neonates with unexplained respiratory distress. The prognosis will depend on the type of CPL and lung involvement.",0,904
71,"Hydatidosis is a zoonosis caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus and Peru is an endemic zone for this infection. We present the case of a 33-year old woman from the region of Ica who, during gestation, was diagnosed with liver and pulmonary hydatidosis. After gestation was terminated, she was referred with thoracic drainage tube, dyspnea, and thoracic pain in right hemithorax, with progressive course and tomographic image of thorax showing right posterior basal pulmonary cyst. The serological analysis was positive, the patient underwent surgical resection with histopathologic result as complex non-viable pulmonary hydatidic cyst and mycotic structure consistent with aspergilloma. The coexistence of these two diseases is rare and can mean potential threats for patients. The early diagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent possible complications such as massive hemoptysis or even invasive disease.",0,918
72,"The inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT) is a non-neoplastic entity of unknown origin, and is characterised by a proliferation of connective tissue and a polyclonal inflammatory infiltrate. Central nervous system involvement is uncommon, and usually represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge even for the experienced clinician. This reports deals with the case of a 56year-old woman diagnosed with a giant, infiltrating mass centred in the left cavernous sinus, who had a rapid clinical and radiological response to steroid therapy. Biopsy specimens were diagnostic for IPT. The progression of a small orbital residual lesion was detected after steroid withdrawal. Treatment with cyclophosphamide induced a complete response that remains stable after six years of follow-up.",0,777
73,"Background: Spigelian hernia is a ventral hernia in the anterior abdominal wall extremely rare in children. Clinic Case: A 13 years old patient is presented with a Spigelian hernia. A surgical repair was successfully performed through a laparoscopic transperitoneal approach without prosthetic reinforcement. A review of 35 pediatric patients published on PubMed between 2000 and 2015 was performed and different therapeutic approaches in pediatric patients were analyzed. Only one patient, and the case reported on this paper, was entirely treated with a laparoscopic approach. Conclusions: Spigelian hernias in childhood can be securely closured with laparoscopic transperitoneal approach.",0,691
74,"We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with congestive heart failure due to a bicuspid aortic valve and severe aortic stenosis. The patient had a febrile syndrome with positive blood cultures for Abiotrophia defectiva, Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed the presence of paravalvular abscess, which was treated by a successful valve replacement. The patient received appropriate antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin, leading to a successful response. The use of MALDI-TOF MS as a rapid and specific method for the microbiological diagnosis is discussed in the following report.",0,594
75,OBJECTIVE: To report an unusual case of softtissue neoplasm and to review the literature on this type of tumour. METHODS: We report an accidentally found tumour closely related to the spermatic cord that was diagnosed in a 70 year-old man when he was being operated on for an inguinal hernia repair. RESULTS: After thorough analysis by experienced pathologists it was not possible to determine the nature of the tumour that was removed at surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissues neoplasms of the spermatic cord may occur in an unusual way and they may be a real challenge to diagnose.,0,579
76,"Lung isolation in thoracic surgery is a challenge, this is even more complex in the presence of unknown tracheal stenosis (TS). We report two cases of unknown TS and its airway management. TS appears most frequently after long term intubation close to the endotracheal tube cuff or in the stoma of tracheostomy that appears as a consequence of the granulation tissue after the surgical opening of the trachea. Clinical history, physical examination, difficult intubating predictors and imaging tests (CT scans) are crucial, however most of tracheal stenosis may be unnoticed and symptoms depend on the degree of obstruction. In our cases, the patients presented anatomical changes due to surgery and previous tracheostomy that led to a TS without symptoms. There is scarce literature about the intubation in patients with previous tracheostomy in thoracic surgery. In the first case, a Univent((R)) tube was used using a flexible fiberscope but an acute tracheal hemorrhage occurred. In the second case, after intubation with VivaSight SL((R)) in an awake patient, the insertion of a bronchial blocker was performed through an endotracheal tube guided by its integrated camera without using flexible fiberscopy.",0,1211
77,"Introduction: Background: primary trimethylaminuria or fish odor syndrome is a genetic metabolopathy characterized by the accumulation of trimethylamine, a very volatile compound in body secretions. Case report: we present the case of a healthy 8-month-old patient who, after the introduction of fish in the diet, starts a bad body odor that does not disappear with bathing. The mother visits the pediatrician repeatedly but no disorder is identified. The diagnosis is delayed until the patient is three years old. Due to maternal insistence, the patient is referred to our hospital unit, where genetic diagnostic tests are performed, enabling the paternal diagnosis that had gone unnoticed for 35 years and detecting three different mutations in the family. Discussion: primary trimethylaminuria is a genetic disease with specific symptomatology of bad body odor that can go unnoticed for many years. An adequate clinical suspicion and the request of adequate complementary tests allow its diagnosis and facilitate its clinical management.",0,1040
78,"We report a 39-year-old female who underwent a total thyroidectomy as treatment for a thyroid papillary cancer. She suffered several episodes of mild angioedema in lips and tongue, after using different commercial Levothyroxine formulations, with and without excipients. Given the need to use this drug, the patient was admitted in our hospital and we proceeded to desensitize her with oral Levothyroxine. The patient fasted throughout the whole procedure, was properly monitored and had an adequate peripheral venous access. On the first day of the procedure, a 15-step protocol was performed, first administering placebo and then, compounded formulations of Levothyroxine starting from 0.01 ug, followed by doubling doses every 15 minutes until the cumulative dose of 111.95 ug was completed, corresponding to the daily dose of Levothyroxine her endocrinologist prescribed (112 ug). The patient was monitored at baseline, between each dose and up to 3 hours after the procedure was completed. There were no incidents such as urticaria, angioedema, or others. On the second day, the patient received a single-full dose of 112 ug on an empty stomach. The medication was successfully tolerated and she was discharged. Thereafter, she tolerates daily Levothyroxine.",0,1263
79,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in treating a patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). METHODS: The effect of HFNC applied in the first imported MERS patient with complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to China was observed. The patient was admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital on May 28th, 2015, and the changes in various clinical parameters and their significance were analyzed. RESULTS: A 43-year old male was admitted to negative pressure isolation intensive care unit with the complaint of back ache for 7 days and fever for 2 days. Vital signs and saturation of pulse oximetry (SpO2) were monitored continuously. After admission, ribavirin was given orally for 12 days and alpha-interferon was administered once on the first day. However, after 2-week anti-virus therapy, the virus test was positive. Ceftriaxone was given on the 4th day, and it was changed to meropenem on the 3rd day for 2 weeks. Immune globulin was given on the 4th day and continued for 1 week. Thymosin-alpha1 was given on the 8th day and continued for 2 weeks. According to his past history, methimazole had been given continuously for hyperthyroidism and other symptomatic treatment. Oxygen inhalation (6 L/min) was given immediately after admission, but the condition of patient worsened with the following symptoms: frequent cough and obvious shortness of breath. Moreover pleural effusion gradually increased as shown by X-ray. SPO2 was maintained only at about 0.91. Oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) decreased to 144 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). So oxygen inhalation via nasal cannula was changed to HFNC after 2 days. The parameters were set as follows: temperature 34 degrees C, flow rate 20 L/min, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.50. The flow was raised 5 L/min every 10 minutes, and was continued till the target value reached 60 L/min. FiO2 was modified according to SpO2 and PaO2/FiO2. FiO2 was set to 0.80 on the 5th day of admission. Shortness of breath of the patient was improved on the 7th day of admission after the application of HFNC. FiO2 was then decreased to 0.58 as PaO2/FiO2 rose. Then the flow was gradually decreased to 30 L/min. HFNC was reduced with continuous improvement in PaO2/FiO2. HFNC was changed to low flow oxygen inhalation nasal cannula (2-3 L/min) on the 20th day. Oxygen treatment was stopped on the 23rd day, and SpO2 was maintained at 0.98-1.00. Activities on bed were gradually increased. The patient was cured and discharged from hospital on June 26th. The patient showed good tolerance and high compliance during the treatment with HFNC. No nosocomial spread occurred during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC could improve respiratory function of the patient with MERS obviously, and complication ARDS was prevented. HFNC might reduce nosocomial spread.",1,2899
80,"Intestinal parasites are a common pathology in the pediatric practice, constituting a major public health problem. Currently their epidemiology, especially in countries like Ecuador where there are populations and communities where health services are scarce or difficult to access. We report the case of a child with chronic grade 3 malnutrition, from Sarayacu province of Pastaza, Ecuador an endemic area in several parasitosis. The clinical features were lower gastrointestinal bleeding added to chronic anemia and eosinophilia. The patient underwent surgery, colectomy right after finding at colonoscopy mass at the small intestine and colon, which ends with the symptoms.

81,"Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare, malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor that arises from the ducts of sweat glands. Found mainly in patients of advanced age, this tumor has diverse clinical presentations. Histology confirms the diagnosis, detects features relevant to prognosis, and guides treatment. Growth is slow, but the prognosis is poor if the tumor metastasizes to lymph nodes or visceral organs. We report 7 cases of eccrine porocarcinoma, describing patient characteristics, the clinical and histopathologic features of the tumors, and treatments used. Our observations were similar to those of other published case series. Given the lack of therapeutic algorithms or protocols for this carcinoma, we propose a decision-making schema based on our review of the literature and our experience with this case series. The algorithm centers on sentinel lymph node biopsy and histologic features.",0,894
82,"CASE REPORT: A 36 year-old male with a recent HIV diagnosis, presented with loss of vision of his left eye. Ophthalmoscopy revealed a unilateral yellowish placoid lesion in the macula. After fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography, syphilis serology, and cerebrospinal fl uid results, he was diagnosed with neurosyphilis and syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. DISCUSSION: Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis is a rare ocular manifestation of syphilis. All patients with characteristic clinical and angiographic fi ndings of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis should be tested for a neurosyphilis and human immunode fi ciency virus co-infection.

83,"INTRODUCTION: Juvenile granulosa cell tumors (JGCT) are very rare, especially in infants under the age of one. The most frequent presentation is with signs of precocious puberty. OBJECTIVE: Present an in fant with peripheral precocious puberty, diagnosis of JGCT and follow up. CLINICAL CASE: 10-month-old female infant with thelarche, pubic hair and palpable abdominal mass accompanied with eleva ted levels of estradiol, very low gonadotrophins and images that show a very large ovarian mass. A sapingooforectomy was carried out with full regression of symptoms and signs and improvement of laboratory exams. The biopsy showed TCGJ so inhibin B (InB) was taken as tumoral marker after surgery. This hormone was high initially, but rapidly declined. Follow-up was based on InB, antimu-llerian Hormone (AMH) and estradiol as described in this type of tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenil gra nulosa cell tumors are very infrequent in pediatric age, but should be suspected in girl with peripheral precocious puberty. The majority of cases improve with surgery, but strict surveillance of tumoral markers is needed. The most specific markers are inhibin B and anti mullerian hormone (AMH), followed by estradiol levels.",0,1210
84,"INTRODUCTION: Bloody nipple discharge is an infrequent symptom during childhood. The most common cause in this population is mammary duct ectasia (MDE), which is a benign and self-limiting condition, that is characterized by dilatation of the mammary ducts, fibrosis and periductal inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Report of a case of MDE in order to improve physicians' diagnosis accuracy and avoid aggressive studies and treatments. CASE REPORT: Six-months old male healthy infant, exclusively breastfeeded, that visited our clinic with a lump beneath his right nipple and bloody discharge from the same nipple. An ultrasound was performed which showed a multicystic lesion suggestive of MDE. Watchful waiting was decided as treatment, with good evolution after six months of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The MDE is the leading cause of bloody discharge in pediatric population, being a benign condition that resolves spontaneously before nine months. The knowledge of this condition is essential so as to accurately diagnose and treat it.",0,1028
85,"The case concerns a 58 year-old female with no medical history of interest who consulted due to binocular diplopia of one week onset. It was associated with costal pain, dyspnoea, intense asthenia and weight loss of 2 months onset. In the blood analysis in the Emergency Department it showed hypercalcaemia, renal failure, and bicytopenia. The chest x-ray showed lytic bone lesions that initially lead to multiple myeloma with extra-osseous involvement. In addition to the corresponding study, in case of horizontal diplopia, a cranial CT scan without contrast was performed where an adjacent lesion to the lateral wall of the left orbit is observed. This was of soft tissue density, and included the external rectus muscle that exerts a mass effect on the optic nerve by displacing it medially. Many lytic bone diffuse lesions with salt and pepper pattern were found in the calotte. A rectus lateral muscle and bone biopsy of the sacral wing was performed, resulting in metastasis of carcinoma compatible with mammary origin. An atypical case is presented of horizontal diplopia in the context of a patient with a severe constitutional picture with no established diagnosis, in which the biopsy of the lateral rectum was key to the confirmation diagnosis.",0,1256

89,"The concept of arthrogryposis encompasses several conditions that share the presence of multiple congenital contractures. The knee is frequently involved and is an important cause of morbidity in these patients. Flexion contractures of the knee are the most common ones and have a worse prognosis than extension contractures. Different approaches are available to treat flexion contractures of the knee. Distal femoral extension osteotomy effectively corrects fixed flexion, but may lead to residual deformity. This iatrogenic deformity disrupts the anterior convexity of the femoral shaft and leads to serious problems in the subsequent management of orthopedic conditions. This is a case report of a patient with arthrogryposis and a femur deformity who sustained a supracondylar fracture. Managing the fracture was challenging due to a disruption in the normal architecture of the femur. This is a description of the osteosynthesis approach used to treat the fracture and the patients pre-existing deformity.",0,1011

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypertensive choroidopathy associated with adrenal carcinoma.",0,517
91,"We report two cases of acute aseptic meningitis associated to mumps in middle-aged women, one pregnant. Both presented shortly after parotid gland enlargement. Neurological complications were suspected by headache, fever and meningeal signs and confirmed by CSF findings (mononuclear predominant pleocytosis) with negative results for alternative causes. Mumps were confirmed by positive IgM and IgG serology. Both patients were discharged with a favorable evolution and complete disappearance of symptoms. Cases were concurrent with a regional mumps outbreak. Conclusions: Aseptic meningitis is a rare mumps-associated neurological complication. Its diagnostic can be achieved by precedent parotid enlargement, mononuclear pleocytosis in the CSF and positive IgM and IgG serology or viral detection by PCR in urine or salivary samples. This complication would be more probably observed during mumps outbreaks.",0,910

96,"Recently, a number of reports have been published on silicosis in workers exposed to artificial quartz conglomerates containing high levels of crystalline silica particles (70-90%) used in the construction of kitchen and bathroom surfaces. Three cases of silicosis in workers exposed to artificial quartz conglomerates are reported. The diagnosis was derived from both the International Labour Office and the International Classification of HRCT for Occupational and Environmental Respiratory Diseases (ICOERD) classifications and cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In 2 cases, levels of respirable silica greatly in excess of recommended standards were measured in the workplace, and cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid highlighted a prevalence of lymphocytes, meeting criteria for the diagnosis of accelerated silicosis. The prevention of pneumoconiosis caused by the use of innovative materials, such as artificial conglomerates with high crystalline silica content must be addressed.",0,1023

98,"The insulinoma is the most common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Surgery is curative in most cases, an appropriate preoperative localization allows a minimal invasive surgical technique for keeping the exo and endocrine function of the pancreas. Some authors suggest the use of invasive localization techniques just in cases with non-identified tumor lesion, others recommend their routinely use. We describe a case with clinical and biochemical diagnosis of insulinoma, conventional image studies revealed a tumor image in the pancreas which corresponded to a lipoma, the intraoperative ultrasound allowed the localization of the real tumor, but body-tail pancreatectomy was performed due to pancreatic necrosis in relation with the duration of the surgery. The systematic use of invasive localization techniques as the intra-arterial calcium stimulation and the pancreatic intraoperative ultrasound would allow a better localization of insulinoma for avoiding complications and associated morbidity.",0,1003
99,"Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is a group of 4 isoenzymes produced in different tissues. Elevated levels of ALP can be developed under physiological conditions, and can indicate the presence of bone or hepatobiliary diseases. In children, one of its most common harmless causes is benign transient hyperphosphatasaemia (BTH), a little known condition. The objective is to report BTH cases and propose a monitoring plan. CASE REPORTS: The cases of 5 children aged between 11 and 50 months are presented, 4 of them female, with the incidental finding of a sudden and severe ALP elevation (> 1,000 U/l), in tests ordered due to either abnormal growth and development, or intercurrent infections. Bone and liver disease were ruled out using the patient history, physical examination and basic laboratory results. Isoenzymes levels were determined in 2 patients. A return to normal ALP levels was observed over a period of 1-6 months, with no evidence of further complications. CONCLUSION: BTH is a benign self-limiting biochemical disorder, which should be considered in children under 5 years old with severe ALP elevation in the absence of clinical or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of bone or liver disease.",0,1207
100,Articular tuberculosis of the ankle joint is a rare presentation of skeletal tuberculosis (10% of cases). This unusual location and the low index of clinical suspicion leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Radiographic and analytic studies are unspecific in the first stage. CAT and MRI are useful in diagnosis. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment and surgery is often required to establish the diagnosis and in the treatment. We report a case of ankle tuberculosis in a 22 month-old child. The diagnosis was confirmed by synovial biopsy. There was no patient or family contact with tuberculosis patients. There was no risk factor. There was no lung disease. Diagnosis was made 1 year after onset of symptoms. The treatment was with chemotherapy and surgery was performed as preventive treatment of equinus deformity and osteoarthritis. Good clinical and functional outcome was achieved after 20 years of follow up.,0,927

102,"Human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7) is a cause of encephalitis, meningitis and myeloradiculoneuropathy in adults who are immunocompetent or with immunosuppression. The involvement of the peripheral nervous system is always associated with myelitis. We report a case of acute polyradiculoneuropathy due to HHV-7, without involvement of central nervous system, in an immunocompetent patient. A 35-years-old man complained of lumbar pain radiating to both buttocks. On examination muscle strength and tendon reflexes were normal. He had asymmetric pinprick and light touch saddle hypoesthesia and also in the perineal region, dorsum and lateral aspect of the left foot. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild thickening and contrast enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots. Polymerase chain reaction performed on cerebrospinal fluid was positive for HVV-7.

103,"Isolated hydrocephalus of the lateral ventricle may result from unilateral occlusion of the foramen of Monro. The most common causes are tumours of the lateral ventricles or in the area of the third ventricle. Non-tumoural stenosis of the foramen is rare and can be due to inflammatory, vascular or congenital conditions. A full-term infant was prenatally diagnosed with unilateral hydrocephalus. After birth, progressive unilateral ventricular dilatation was confirmed in successive ultrasounds so surgery was indicated. The patient underwent endoscopic fenestration of the foramen of Monro and septostomy with good postoperative clinical evolution and reduction of ventricular size. Intraoperative findings demonstrated membranous obstruction of the right foramen of Monro. A successful treatment can be accomplished through a neuroendoscopic approach avoiding the use of ventricular shunts.",0,893
104,"INTRODUCTION: Cleidocraneal dysplasia (CCD) is a rare skeletal autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by dental anomalies and bone abnormalities. These clinical manifestations do not require treatment in most cases. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene RUNX2 (CBAF1), located on the short arm of chromosome 6. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of CCD and perform a literature review focused on clinical manifestations and diagnosis. CASE REPORT: A 3 year old patient, who was clinically diagnosed with CCD since birth. The patient showed incomplete development of cranial bones, bell-shaped thorax, adequate dentition and presence of clavicles. Molecular analysis reported that the patient is carrying the pathogenic variant c.674G>A in the RUNX2 gene, confirming the diagnosis.

105,"Out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (OHCA) is highly lethal. Although overall survival is increasing, hospital discharge with good neurological prognosis remains low and highly variable. In some countries, protocols are being implemented, which include techniques in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, allowing a better neurological prognosis for those patients who undergo an OHCA. Following these new techniques and the incorporation of these new protocols already accepted in the guidelines of advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we report a 54 years old male who presented an OHCA and received advanced cardiopulmonary by a professional team in situ. He was transferred to the emergency department, where optimal advanced resuscitation was continued, until the connection to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support, with the aim of reestablishing blood flow, a technique known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR: extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation).

We report two unvaccinated adult patients with smoking habit, which were admitted with severe influenza A H1N1pdm09 that evolved with shock and required mechanical ventilation. Both patients developed progressive renal failure with oliguria/anuria, associated with urinary of inflammatory sediment with proteinuria, microhematuria and in one case also with hypocomplementemia, suggesting acute glomerulonephritis. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in both cases. In one patient, who died of late complications, sequencing of the HA1 segment revealed the previously described D222N mutation associated to severe cases. ARF with RRT appears to be an uncommon complication of patients hospitalized for influenza A H1N1pdm09 and may be secondary to acute glomerulonephritis.",0,882

Hypertension is often a constant sign in most patients. There are few cases in literature reporting pheochromocytoma presented with polyuria. We present a 13-year-old girl who came to the Pediatric Nephrologist due to a year of evolution of secondary enuresis. When her blood pressure was taken, she was above the 99th percentile that corresponds to her age and her height that is why she was admitted for treatment and diagnostic study.",0,628
110,"INTRODUCTION: Botulism is a syndrome caused by the toxin of the bacillus Clostridium botulinum. The toxin acts by blocking the presynaptic cholinergic endings of the neuromuscular junction and of the parasympathetic nervous system, and gives rise to a flaccid paralysis and parasympathetic failure. The most common way to catch the disease is by ingestion of the preformed toxin present in badly sterilised home-made preserves, although other mechanisms are also possible. Its incidence in Spain today is very low. CASE REPORTS: We report the case of three members of a family living together who presented a clinical picture of food-borne botulism. The initial clinical symptoms showed a predilection for ocular paresis and for dysautonomic symptoms of little specificity, and the familial aggregation was the fundamental evidence that suggested the diagnosis. Later, the patients' state got worse and two of them presented involvement of the respiratory function and required a lengthy stay in the intensive care unit. After a period of convalescence the three patients recovered without any sequelae. Botulinum toxin was detected by bioassay in some food samples, which allowed the diagnosis to be categorised as confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The familial microepidemic reported here is a case of predominantly ocular and dysautonomic involvement. Likewise, it illustrates several aspects that are typical of the disease: the suspected diagnosis in cohabiting patients who visit at the same time for a similar clinical picture, the characteristic complications of the process and its treatment, the laboratory diagnosis and its natural history towards resolution.",0,1660
111,"Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is characterized by spontaneous hypoglycemia with extremely high insulin levels and the presence of circulating autoantibodies against insulin, in patients who have never been exposed to exogenous insulin. We report two patients with the syndrome. A 36 years old male presenting with hypoglycemia in the emergency room had an oral glucose tolerance test showed basal and 120 min glucose levels of 88 and 185 mg/dl. The basal and 120 min insulin levels were 2,759 and 5,942 muUI/ml. The presence of an insulin secreting tumor was discarded. Anti-insulin antibodies were positive. He was successfully treated with a diet restricted in carbohydrates and frequent meals in small quantities. A 65 years old female presenting with hypoglycemia in the emergency room had the fasting insulin levels of 1,910 microUI/ml. No insulin secreting tumor was detected by images and anti-insulin antibodies were positive.

114,"Appendicitis is the most frequent surgical disease in childhood, but it is very uncommon in the neonatal period. In this period of life, a delay in diagnosis (frequently due to the rareness of this pathology and lack of clinical suspicion) and consequently in therapeutic approach, frequently results in appendicular perforation and a subsequently poor evolution of this pathology. We present the case of a neonate with a history of Down's syndrome and Fallot's tetralogy. Due to her basal cardiopathy, she required surgical intervention to create a systemic-pulmonary fistula, as a temporary bridge until definitive cardiac surgery could be performed. In the postoperative period of this surgery she presented fever, acute abdomen and abdominal radiography compatible with pneumoperitoneum. An emergency laparotomy was performed, which revealed peritonitis secondary to a cecal gangrenous appendix with perforation in its middle third. Neonatal appendicitis is usually associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis, necrotizing enterocolitis, or Hirschsprung's disease, as in the case of our patient. In neonates with acute abdomen and presence of pneumoperitoneum, appendicitis must be part of the differential diagnosis and requires urgent surgical intervention. Despite this, it presents a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Once the definitive diagnosis is made, any basal pathology that justifies its presence should be discarded.",0,1442
115,"Protozoic infections are prevalent worldwide, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. We reported the case of a patient from the city of Vina del Mar, Chile, a carrier of acute myeloid leukemia in whom an infection by Lophomonas sp. was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with antibiotics but died of complications of the underlying disease. There is little literature available on this microorganism. We conclude that Lophomonas sp. should be considered as a diagnostic possibility if protozoa are found in bronchoalveolar lavage of immunosuppressed patients.",0,581
116,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of 42 year-old woman with no significant medical history, with severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing loss, and alteration of mental status with disorientation and confusion. Ophthalmic examination showed optic disc hyperaemia in right eye, and focal areas of arteriolar occlusion in both eyes. Audiometry demonstrated bilateral neurosensory hypoacusis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed multiple small round hyperintense lesions located in the splenium, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and white matter. DISCUSSION: Besides branch retinal arteriolar occlusion, the angiopathy in Susac's syndrome may affect the optic disc vessels.",0,674
117,Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous autosomal dominant disorder that results from mutations within either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. Diagnosis is based on well-established clinical criteria or genetic criteria. Clinical features are highly variable and could be developing over the life. We present a case of TSC with a molecular test that identified a novel variant in TSC2 gene. It is a sporadic missense mutation which has not been previously reported in the literature. It is caused by premature termination of protein translation and results in the production of truncated and non-functional proteins. This mutation is considered as a pathogenic variant and allows to broaden the spectrum of variants of TSC2 gene as a cause of TSC.,0,759
118,"A 65 year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis with pulmonary and joint involvement, who after 5 years of diagnosis begins with central nervous system involvement manifesting as diplopia. She presents normal analysis results. In imaging results, a mass is identified in the right intraconal space; it depends of right optic nerve, and shows multiple lymph node involvement. Biopsy was performed diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma, an atypical form of tumor associated with sarcoidosis.",0,491
119,"BACKGROUND: Splenic cysts are rare diseases that are diagnosed incidentally during imaging studies. When cysts are recognized, surgical treatment is recommended adapted to the particular case, depending on the size and location of the cyst and the age of the patient in order to avoid dangerous complications such as spleen rupture or cyst infection with abscess. CLINICAL CASE: We report 2patients with symptomatic splenic epidermoid cyst treated by laparoscopic cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cleavage is a surgical option for splenic cyst, with the goal of reducing postoperative complications while preserving splenic function.",0,636
120,"Postnatal infection or acquired cytomegalovirus in the newborn is transmitted by maternal cervical secretions at birth, breastfeeding, blood transfusion or biological fluids. Breast milk is the main source of infection. Clinical manifestations depend on the gestational age and birth weight, premature and low birth weight newborn being more vulnerable. Postnatal infection usually resolves spontaneously without antiviral treatment; the risk of long-term sequelae is lower than in congenital infection. We describe the case of a 45 days old male patient, term newborn appropriate for gestational age, with a very rare condition characterized by severe thrombocytopenia secondary to postnatal cytomegalovirus infection. We detail its symptoms, clinical evolution, diagnosis and treatment employed.",0,797
121,"INTRODUCTION: Peroxisomal diseases are a group of monogenic disorders that include defects in peroxisome biogenesis or enzyme dificiencies. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1) belongs to the first group, caused by autosomal recessive mutations on PEX7 gene, encoding for PTS2 receptor. The aims of this report are to describe a genetic disease of low prevalence, explaining its main characteristics and the importance of the diagnostic approach and genetic counseling. CASE REPORT: 13-month-old male infant with no medical history, family or consanguinity, demonstrate at birth upper limbs shortening. Surgery intervention at seven months old for bilateral cataract. Growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, minor craniofacial anomalies, rhyzomelic shortened upper limbs and lower limbs lesser degree. Punctata calcifications in patella cartilage. Also fatty acid phytanic and pristanic increased levels. Patient dead at age of 3 years. DISCUSSION: RCDP1 is a rare disease, with a prevalence of 1/100,000. Different mutations of PEX7 gene have been described, with variations in phenotype. The treatment is basically symptomatic and depends on the severity of clinical manifestations. The rhizomelic type has poor prognosis, most patients do not survive before the first decade of live. Genetic counseling is essential because it is consider a 25% risk of recurrence.",0,1387
122,"Pseudoaneurysms of the uterine artery are an uncommon cause of severe gynecological bleeding secondary to surgical manipulation of the pelvis or to instrumental delivery. The different imaging techniques are of vital importance in the diagnosis. Angiography is the technique used for confirmation and also for treatment in many cases. Endovascular treatment by embolizing the pseudoaneurysm has become established as the treatment of choice, making it possible to avoid hysterectomy in women of childbearing age. This article presents two cases of gynecological bleeding due to pseudoaneurysms (one secondary to surgery and one secondary to childbirth) that were embolized in a novel way using cyanoacrylate.",0,708
123,"Patients transplanted from solid organs have an increased risk of cancer, especially lymphomas. Lymphomas correspond to 4 to 5% of malignant neoplasms in the general population and in solid organ transplant patients it reaches an incidence of 21%. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphomas is 10 times higher than in the non-transplanted population. We report the case of a 68-year-old man with a kidney transplant who 6 years after transplantation, developed a non-Hodgkin diffuse large cells B lymphoma with lymph node and pulmonary involvement, with markers of very poor prognosis (triple MYC expressor, BCL2 and BCL6). and its evolution with chemotherapy with DA R EPOCH.",0,672
124,"We present a case of mastitis in a 45-year-old woman with no history of infection in other areas of the body, with unspecific clinical picture, imaging studies, and bacilloscopy. However, histological samples obtained by aspiration showed giant epithelial cells, necrosis, and granulomatous formations, which justified a clinical inclination toward tuberculosis. In the absence of confirmatory evidence of any lesions in other tissues, the existence of mastitis of torpid evolution is a clinical indication to suspect mammary tuberculosis, since the characteristics of the process usually lead to erroneous diagnoses with other breast tumors such as cancer. Tuberculosis in the breast is a rare disease with a difficult diagnosis due to the low clinical and microbiological evidence and the lack of specificity of the imaging results, so the suspicion of its real diagnostic possibility is a fundamental condition for its determination, even when the causal agent is not confirmed.",0,981
125,"We report a case of recurrent bacteraemia caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica in an immunocompromised patient with a history of allogenic bone marrow transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome, who was admitted to hospital with febrile syndrome. Bordetella bronchiseptica is an uncommon human pathogen which mainly affects immunocompromised patients, being a rare cause of bacteraemia.",0,387
126,"The case of a 60 year old woman with hemoptysis and a thin-walled cavitary lesion at the upper lobe of the right lung is presented. The woman presented at the Mycology Unit of the Muniz Hospital in Buenos Aires City 3 months after the beginning of her clinical manifestations. A hyaline micelial fungus with chlamido-arthroconidias was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage. Immunodiffusion and counter-immnunoelectrophoresis with coccidioidin and histoplasmin rendered positive results against both antigents, and skin tests with coccidioidin and histoplasmin were also positive with strong reactions. The isolated fungus was identified as Coccidioides posadasii at the National Microbiology Institute Carlos Malbran, by means of a molecular technique. The patient was treated with itraconazole by oral route at a daily dose of 200mg with good clinical response, but due to the persistence of the lung cavity, a surgical removal of the upper lobe of the right lung had to be scheduled.",0,989
127,"Sarcoidosis is a pleomorphic disease that can present with pulmonary hypertension (PH). What little information is available about the association of these two diseases comes mainly from small series of patients scheduled for transplant. We present 4 cases of mild pulmonary involvement in whom right catheterisation was performed and PH-specific therapy was administered. After obtaining written consent, a genetic study was performed that showed mutations in PH-related genes in 3 of the patients. This is the first study of its kind to yield genetic information for this type of PH.",0,585
128,"A previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with a fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia. The virus (called HCoV-EMC) replicated readily in cell culture, producing cytopathic effects of rounding, detachment, and syncytium formation. The virus represents a novel betacoronavirus species. The closest known relatives are bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. Here, the clinical data, virus isolation, and molecular identification are presented. The clinical picture was remarkably similar to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and reminds us that animal coronaviruses can cause severe disease in humans.",1,726
129,"INTRODUCTION: Cushing's syndrome (CS) is an endocrine disease by to glucocorticoids excess, depen dent or independent of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The main cause is iatrogenic due to excessive use of glucocorticoids. OBJECTIVE: To show the association between prolonged use of topical corticosteroids and the development of CS. CLINICAL CASE: An infant treated with topical corticosteroids due to seborrheic dermatitis. Due to long-term unsupervised use, he develops Cushing's syndrome characterized by obesity and compromised growth rate. Topical use of corticosteroids was discontinued and physiological replacement therapy was initiated with descending doses, achieving clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: Topical corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice for management of dermatological pathologies. These are available in various presentations with va riable efficiency. The main determining factors in its action are the characteristics of the skin, the active principle of the drug, the potency and application technique, so that the adverse effects are observed more frequently in the use due to diaper dermatitis. The main adverse effect of long-term use is Cushing's syndrome which can be prevented through supervised use and progressive decrease. CONCLUSION: The rational and careful use of topical corticosteroids is essential to take advantage of the beneficial effects and avoid adverse effects.",0,1429
130,Dupilumab is a drug that has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. An increase in frequency of conjunctivitis related to dupilumab treatment has been reported in recent publications and clinical trials. We report two steroid-dependent cases satisfactorily treated with cyclosporine 0.1% (Ikervis((R))). To our knowledge there are no reported cases of dupilumab-associated conjunctivitis treated with cyclosporine 0.1% (Ikervis((R))).,0,563
131,"Diaphragmatic rupture is a relatively uncommon entity in pediatrics that can occur as a result of a high-impact trauma. Only between 25 and 50% of the cases are detected in the initial evaluation of the patient, which increases the risk of complications. This paper presents the case of an asymptomatic 8-year-old patient who was referred to our institution after a vehicular accident. A day and a half after admission, a left pulmonary hypoventilation was detected. Computed tomography scan showed intrathoracic elevation of the splenic angle of the colon and the small bowel. Surgical exploration and treatment were performed. Deferred radiographic controls showed no signs of relapse.",0,687
132,"INTRODUCTION AND CASE EVALUATION: Botulism is a rare disease in Europe, caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, notifiable, non-transmissible person-to-person and potentially fatal (between 5 and 10%) if not treated quickly. The favourable opinion of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee was obtained. We present the nursing care plan of a 49-year-old man with a diagnosis of bacterial intoxication caused by Clostridium botulinum, secondary to ingestion of beans in poor condition, who was admitted to the ICU for a total of 35 days. DIAGNOSIS AND PLANNING: Holistic nursing evaluation during the first 24hours, with prioritisation of the systems that were deteriorating fastest: neurological and respiratory. Nine diagnoses were prioritised according to the NANDA taxonomy: Risk for allergy response, Ineffective breathing pattern, impaired oral mucous membrane, Impaired physical mobility, Risk for disuse syndrome, Risk for dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility, Impaired urinary elimination, Risk for acute confusion and Risk for caregiver role strain. DISCUSSION: The nursing care plan, standardised and organised with the NANDA taxonomy and prioritised with the outcome-present state-test (OPT) model, guaranteed the best care based on evidence, as the NOC scores improvement demonstrated. It was impossible to compare the nursing intervention with other case reports.",0,1386

134,"The Klippel-Feil syndrome is a congenital malformation of the skull flap involving complex cervical vertebrae and organs, characterized by a classic triad: short neck, limitation of movement of the head due to cervical spine fusion and low hairline in occipital region. It results from an error in the axial skeleton segmentation of the embryo; its incidence is estimated at 1/40,000-42,000 births and predominates in females. The aim of this paper is to describe the clinical picture of a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome and multiple malformations, including tracheoesophageal fistula, bifid thumb and intracranial lipomas/angiolipomas,that have not been previously described in the syndrome, so it is considered an exceptional finding.",0,740
135,"Many patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) or in secondary prevention situations and with statin intolerance do not achieve LDL-C targets, and require treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors (iPCSK9) and ezetimibe. The case is presented on a patient with FH and total intolerance to statins. Treatment with iPCSK9 and ezetimibe failed to achieve her LDL-C target. A compound with red yeast rice derivatives containing 3mg of monacolin K was added, with good therapeutic compliance, and a very good control of LDL-C. The addition of red yeast rice derivatives containing low doses of monacolin K, together with IPCSK9 in patients with total intolerance to statins, may open a new path to obtain LDL-C targets in patients with high/very high cardiovascular risk.",0,764
136,"Serological, molecular and phylogenetic analyses of a recently imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Greece are reported. Although MERS-CoV remained detectable in the respiratory tract secretions of the patient until the fourth week of illness, viraemia was last detected 2 days after initiation of triple combination therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir, administered from Day 13 of illness. Phylogenetic analysis of the virus showed close similarity with other human MERS-CoVs from the recent Jeddah outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) titres peaked 3 weeks after the onset of illness, whilst IgM levels remained constantly elevated during the follow-up period (second to fifth week of illness). Serological testing confirmed by virus neutralisation assay detected an additional case that was a close contact of the patient.",1,909
137,"OBJECTIVE: To report a clear cell renal cell carcinoma recipient of a metastasizing ductal carcinoma of the breast: A tumor-to-tumor metastasis. METHODS: A 71 year-old woman with a past history of breast carcinoma, diagnosed 12 years before, underwent a nephrectomy for an incidental kidney mass found in a routine imaging examination. RESULTS: Histological examination revealed foci of ductal carcinoma of the breast in an otherwise typical clear cell renal cell carcinoma of the kidney. Immunohistochemical examination confirmed a metastasis of an infiltrating breast carcinoma to a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (positive to GATA3, hormonal receptors and mamoglobin) in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (positive to PAX8, CD10 and vimentin). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of this phenomenon should always be kept in mind by urologist in patients with a known history of a previous malignancy and by pathologists when finding a renal tumor with an unusual or dimorphic morphology. Immunohistochemistry plays an important role to establish the exact diagnosis.",0,1057
138,"CASE REPORT: A 45 year-old man with a history of adrenal phaeochromocytoma presented with a subretinal juxtapapillary haemorrhage on his left eye and a small asymptomatic vascular tumour in the contralateral eye. With the mentioned findings, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral retinal capillary haemangioma in the context of a von Hippel Lindau disease. Intravitreal aflibercept was prescribed, with a good outcome of the disease. DISCUSSION: Many treatments have been proposed for the management of juxtapapillary retinal capillary haemangioma with variable results. Intravitreal aflibercept can be a useful treatment with a good safety profile.",0,652
139,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection is an important cause of morbimortality in patients with severe burns. The advances in burn care therapy have considerably extended the survival of seriously burned patients, exposing them to infectious complications, notably fungal infections, with increased recognition of invasive infections caused by Candida species. However, some opportunistic fungi, like Trichosporon asahii, have emerged as important causes of nosocomial infection. CASE REPORT: A case of nosocomial infection due to T. asahii in a severely ill burned patient successfully treated with voriconazole is presented. The management of invasive fungal infections in burned patients, from diagnosis to selection of the therapeutic protocol, is often a challenge. Early diagnosis and treatment are associated with a better prognosis. In this case report, current treatment options are discussed, and a review of previously published cases is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the difficulty in the diagnosis of invasive mycoses and their high associated mortality rates, it is advisable to keep a high degree of clinical suspicion of trichosporonosis in susceptible patients, including burned patients. The isolation of T. asahii in clinical specimens of this type of host must raise clinical alert, since it may precede an invasive infection.",0,1346
140,"Strongyloidiasis is a neglected disease in Latin America. Gastrointestinal manifestations are nonspecific and duodenal obstruction is a rare complication. Here we present the case of a 31-year-old male from the central jungle of Peru, admitted due to a high intestinal obstruction, with duodenal ulcers and stenosis evidenced in the upper endoscopy. The histopathological report revealed presence of larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis. Clinical and endoscopic follow up were favorable with ivermectin treatment. There are near 20 reported cases of duodenal obstruction due to S. stercoralis. Additionally, infection by HTLV-1 was confirmed, being this a frequent association.",0,676
141,"OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a patient with a posterior microphthalmos-optic disc drusen-retinitis pigmentosa syndrome associated, for the first time, with white dots in the posterior pole. METHODOLOGY: The posterior microphthalmos, retinitis pigmentosa and optic disc drusen syndrome was described for the first time in literature in 1991. Later, it was associated with a pattern of foveal thickening and/or foveoschisis. Different forms of mutations on chromosomes 11 and 14 have been identified as being responsible for the appearance of this syndrome, but the inheritance pattern is unknown. DISCUSSION: The case is reported of a 37 year-old man, with no personal or family history of interest, diagnosed with this syndrome in association with white dots in the posterior pole. Such a morphological association has never been published before in literature. CONCLUSION: The posterior microphthalmos, retinitis pigmentosa and optic disc drusen syndrome is a very rare entity, and has never been described associated with white dots in the posterior pole. More case reports are needed to establish clear patterns of both the disease and inheritance.",0,1156
142,"Filariasis is a parasitic disease with a benign course caused by nematodes. Filariasis is endemic in some tropical regions, and immigration has made it increasingly common in some centers in Spain. The death of the parasites can lead to calcifications that are visible in mammograms; these calcifications have specific characteristics and should not be confused with those arising in other diseases. However, the appearance of calcifications due to filariasis is not included in the most common systems used for the classification of calcifications on mammograms (BI-RADS), and this can lead to confusion. In this article, we discuss the need to update classification systems and warn radiologists about the appearance of these calcifications to ensure their correct diagnosis and avoid confusion with other diseases.",0,817
143,"Papillary tumor of the pineal region is a rare neuroepithelial tumor characterized by papillary architecture and epithelial cytology, immunopositivity for cytokeratin and ependymal differentiation. It is considered grade II-III by the World Health Organization and was first described by Jouvet in 2003. We present a 34-year-old male with headaches, blurred vision and normal examination. Radiological study showed a nodulocystic lesion in the pineal region compatible with pineocytoma. Surgery was performed using an infratentorial supracerebellar approach, finding a cystic tumor in the quadrigeminal cistern which was completely resected. Histopathology reported a papillary tumor of the pineal region. The patient made good progress without adjuvant therapy, and after 57 months of follow-up he remained asymptomatic and free of recurrence. A review of the literature was performed to collect all the cases published with gross total resection and no complementary treatment. In conclusion, there is still much to be learned about the pathogenesis, prognosis and management of this tumor.",0,1092
144,"The differential diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is often complex due to a wide clinical variability of its presentation, including psychiatric manifestations. We report a 68 years old male with a history of depression treated with venlafaxine, mirtazapine, quetiapine and risperidone, presenting in the emergency room with confusion and generalized rigidity. A brain CT scan did not show lesions. A neuroleptic syndrome was initially suspected. At the third day the obtundation worsened and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, which showed epileptiform abnormalities. Treatment with valproic acid resulted in disappearance of such abnormalities. After three weeks of mechanical ventilation, the patient was extubated and remained lucid and partially orientated in time and space.",0,811
145,"OBJECTIVE: Knee involvement of soft tissue sarcomas is rare and very difficult to treat. Reconstruction of the extensor mechanism of the knee is essential to restore the functionality. Functional outcome is compromised by poor soft tissue coverage, adjuvant local radiotherapy, and resection of the extensor apparatus. No results were found in the literature as regards treatment by resection and reconstruction of the extensor mechanism in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy. The effects of radiotherapy are also unknown in the allografts. MATERIAL AND METHOD: . Two cases are presented of soft tissue sarcoma around de knee treated by resection, reconstruction of the extensor mechanism with cryopreserved cadaver allograft, and local radiotherapy. RESULTS: After more than 3 years of follow up, both patients are free of disease and have a good joint balance. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Resection of the tumor with adequate safety margins and reconstruction using cadaveric allograft preserves the extensor mechanism and function of the limb. The soft tissue coverage is an added problem that can be solved by propeller fasciocutaneous flap coverage. After surgery, the limb must be immobilized with a knee brace locked in extension. Local radiotherapy contributes to local control of the disease. The reconstruction of the extensor mechanism of the knee with allograft is a functional alternative to amputation, and it does not contraindicate adjuvant radiotherapy to improve local control of the disease.",0,1514
146,"CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 56 year-old patient diagnosed with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and on treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). A Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was performed that showed changes in the outer retina in the eye with macular detachment, as well as the <<flying saucer>> sign in the other eye. After a complete retinopexy the <<flying saucer>> sign was still present. DISCUSSION: SD-OCT could be used as a test in order to reveal HCQ toxicity in the event of retinal detachment. In this case, this technique shows abnormalities such as a hyper-reflective line in the outer retina layers.",0,654
147,"Orthotopic cardiac retransplantation is used to treat transplanted cardiac graft end-stage failure. We present the first case of successful elective cardiac retransplantation in Mexico. It was a 25-year old male with heart transplantation who developed graft-resistant chronic vasculopathy. He underwent elective retransplantation in September 2017; complications during postoperative evolution were treated with favorable response. He was discharged owing to improvement at four weeks postoperatively. It is concluded that in adequately selected cases and comprehensively assessed, cardiac retransplantation is an appropriate option to treat cardiac graft failure.",0,665
148,"Dengue is the disease transmitted by arthropods of major importance in public health; however its presence in the neonatal stage is poorly studied, with few cases described worldwide. We present the case report of a neonate who started illness at 12 days of age, characterized by fever and irritability. He was hospitalized for suspicion of neonatal sepsis; later he presented thrombocytopenia and due the antecedent of his mother with diagnosis of dengue after childbirth, dengue tests were obtained in the neonate, resulting positive, then support treatment and fluid treatment is performed, with subsequent recovery. Dengue in the neonatal stage should always be suspected in areas where the disease is endemic and management guides should be proposed.",0,755
149,"BACKGROUND: The most common manifestation of MEN 1 syndrome is primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) with parathyroid multiglandular affectation. The intrathyroidal situation represents 3-4% of all glands, and it is the second most frequent location in the cervical ectopias. CLINICAL CASE: 11 year old patient, with a family history of MEN1 syndrome and carrier of this same mutation. Patient presents HPTP with osteopenia. The cervical ultrasound shows three compatible images with pathological parathyroid glands (bilateral lower and upper left). The Scan and MRI are normal. Bone densitometry displays data on osteopenia. The patient is surgically intervened, only the upper parathyroid glands are located and removed, after this implantation is performed on the forearm, to prevent the possible devascularization in the dissection of the other glands. However, osteopenia persists and an elevated PTH, therefore new diagnostic tests are held which seem to show two lower parathyroid glands with intrathyroidal location. The patient is reoperated. A subtotal parathyroidectomy of the lower right gland and the resection of the left gland is performed, with the use of intraoperative ultrasound and placement of harpoon. The intraoperative pathology study confirms parathyroid tissue in both cases. DISCUSSION: It is necessary to locate the parathyroid glands preoperatively in order to alert us of the existence of topographical and ectopia abnormalities, as well as their intrathyroidal location (0.5-3.6%). CONCLUSION: The intraoperative ultrasound can be a complement to the experience of the endocrine surgeon for the localization of the parathyroid glands and therefore can help determine the best surgical strategy for each clinical case.",0,1745
150,"We report the case of a 94-year-old woman with Bouveret's syndrome, where endoscopic treatment was performed. Bouveret's syndrome is a gastric outlet obstruction due to gallstone impaction within the duodenum. It is the least frequent presentation of gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus is a complication of cholelithiasis and has a high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it requires an early diagnosis and urgent treatment, which is usually surgical. The peculiarity of this case is that we obtained the full resolution of the symptoms by endoscopic treatment in an elderly patient with high surgical risk.",0,606
151,"The dermoscopic island is described as a well-defined area in a melanocytic lesion, with a different dermoscopic pattern from the rest of the lesion. It is predictive of melanoma, particularly when the pattern of the island is atypical. We present the reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) findings in 3 lesions with dermoscopic islands: nevus-associated melanoma, melanocytic nevus, and in situ melanoma. The nevus-associated melanoma and in situ melanoma presented cellular atypia (atypical cells in isolation or forming nests) and architectural distortion on RCM. The nevus presented a dermoscopic island with a typical globular pattern with dense nests and no atypia on RCM. Dermoscopic island is mainly associated with in situ and nevus-associated melanomas. RCM offers good cellular resolution to the depth of the reticular dermis and is useful for diagnosing of melanomas presenting a dermoscopic island.",0,911

EXAMINATION: VA 1 in right eye, and 0.1 in LE, discrete left relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD). Normal biomicroscopy. Funduscopy: congestive papilla, venous tortuosity, peripapillary haemorrhages with macular oedema in LE. The systemic study only revealed A C46Tpolymorphism in the F12 coagulation gene. He had a VA of 1 and normal funduscopy 8 months later. DISCUSSION: Papillophlebitis is an inflammatory and non-ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion, ophthalmoscopically similar to central retinal vein thrombosis. The systemic study is essential to rule out underlying diseases.",0,707
153,"INTRODUCTION: Gelastic seizures are infrequent epileptic seizures in which the main manifestation is inappropriate laughter. They have a variety of causations. A search of the literature did not reveal any cases of pathological laughter that was clearly related with strokes, although there a numerous reports of non-epileptic pathological laughter as a prodromal symptom in stroke patients (fou rire prodromique). We report the case of a patient with infarcted cingulate gyrus who progressed with gelastic seizures at onset and during the course of the clinical process. CASE REPORT: An 81-year-old female who suddenly presented bouts of difficulties in verbal expression with disconnection from the milieu that were accompanied by fits of unmotivated and uncontrollable laughter that lasted less than five minutes. Following the attacks, her level of consciousness had dropped. In some of the attacks there were also involuntary movements of the upper limbs. Resonance imaging revealed the existence of an acute ischaemic lesion in the left territory of the cingulate gyrus and an electroencephalogram revealed the existence of epileptogenic activity in the left-hand anterior temporal and frontal regions. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical profile, the results of the complementary examinations and the response to the antiepileptic treatment allow us to state that in the episode reported in this patient we are dealing with gelastic seizures related to an acute ischaemic lesion in the left cingulate gyrus.",0,1504
154,"Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumours that originate in Schwann cells. They are usually solitary and sporadic and manifest on peripheral, spinal or cranial nerves. Intracranial schwannomas tend to manifest on the eighth cranial nerve, particularly in patients with neurofibromatosis type2. Anterior skull-base schwannomas represent less than 1% of all intracranial schwannomas. They are more frequent in young people and are typically benign. These tumours represent a diagnostic challenge due to their rarity and difficult differential diagnosis, and numerous theories have been postulated concerning their origin and development. In this article, we present the case of a 13-year-old male with a single anterior cranial-base tumour not associated with neurofibromatosis who presented with headache, papilloedema, eye pain and loss of visual acuity. Complete resection of the tumour was performed, which was histopathologically diagnosed as a schwannoma. The patient made a complete clinical recovery with abatement of all symptoms. We conducted a review of the literature and found 66 cases worldwide with this diagnosis. We describe the most relevant epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this kind of tumour and its relation with the recently discovered and similar olfactory schwannoma.",0,1300

It is a type of exceptional dislocation which in our case was not accompanied by lesions of the joint surfaces of the elbow unlike most cases already published. This article stresses the importance of making an early diagnosis of this variety of dislocation; this is the best way to prevent it from going unnoticed. The use of Computed Tomography (CT) helped this early diagnosis, enabling an immediate closed orthopaedic reduction and achieving a cure without sequelae.",0,618
157,"CASE REPORT: The case involves a 35-year-old man, with a history of retinitis pigmentosa, who presented with a bilateral cystoid macular oedema associated with bilateral epiretinal membrane, which was resistant to treatment with oral acetazolamide and intravitreal bevacizumab. The treatment with oral eplerenone was able to improve the visual acuity and macular thickness of this patient. DISCUSSION: A variety of treatments have been proposed for the management of cystoid macular oedema, associated with retinitis pigmentosa, with variable results. The treatment with oral eplerenone might be a good option for the control of this condition.",0,644
158,"Boerhaave's syndrome is a spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus, caused by an increase of intraluminal pressure that is produced in the context of negative intrathoracic pressure. It has a high index of morbimortality (14-40%), which is why it requires early diagnosis and treatment. When a patient presents vomiting, the differential diagnosis should include epigastric pain. Para-esophageal hiatal hernias can be complicated by gastric volvulus. In its turn, this can produce both oesophageal and gastric necrosis requiring early surgical treatment. We describe the case of an 83-year-old patient who presented gastric volvulus with complications from a hiatal hernia with associated vomiting, which triggered Boerhaave s syndrome. This is the second case published in the literature. Key words. Boerhaave s syndrome. Gastric volvulus. Surgical treatment.",0,857
159,"The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients who can not obtain their nutritional requirements by the enteral route is increasing in recent years, allowing normalization lifestyle of patients. Neoplasm and mesenteric ischaemia are some of the diseases that most frequently require HPN in Spain. However, HPN is one of the cornerstones of the treatment of much less frequent illnesses as in the case of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. We present the case of a patient with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis and HPN support for more than 7 years with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for over 6 years without complications and the autonomy to perform his normal business activity. Given the exceptional nature of the case we refer it to its publication.",0,781
160,"We have used a new device to prevent pulmonary embolism during pharmacomechanical thrombectomy in a 25-year-old postpartum woman. The Angel(R) catheter (BiO2 Medical Inc., Golden, CO, USA) is a temporary device that combines the functions of a vena cava filter (VCF) with those of a triple-lumen central venous catheter. Normally, a VCF is implanted to prevent pulmonary embolism during pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. However, the complications associated with VCFs increase with time, not all of the filter can always be retrieved, and there can be iatrogenic effects both during implantation and retrieval. In our experience, this new device is much simpler to deploy and to retrieve. As is shown in this case, this temporary device can be an interesting alternative to a VCF for preventing pulmonary embolisms during pharmacomechanical thrombectomy.",0,854
161,"INTRODUCTION: Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a low-incidence disease due to inherited or acquired zinc deficiency. It is characterized by acral dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea and growth retardation. The dermatological condition may mimic a cutaneous fungal infection or other pathogen-related skin diseases. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a female patient of 7 months of age, who was sent to Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre for suspicion of immunodeficiency and cutaneous mycosis. Her condition began with dermatosis disseminated to the head, trunk and genital region; initial treatment with antifungal and broad spectrum antibiotics was given, without improvement. Upon admission, immunodeficiency and fungal infection were discarded. Acrodermatitis enteropathica was suspected, and corroborated later by low serum zinc levels. Immediately after the start of oral treatment with zinc, the patient showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple differential diagnoses of acrodermatitis enteropathica, which includes cutaneous infections. Therefore, the early recognition of the characteristic lesions favors suspicion, diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",0,1172
162,"OBJECTIVE: To report two new cases of IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis, a recently described pathology. METHODS: We analyze two cases diagnosed in our center and performed a literature review. RESULT: IgG4 related disease is a recently described entity that includes previously not related pathologies. The clinical manifestations are highly variable and its presentation is usually subacute. The treatment of choice is glucocorticoids. In our first case the outcome was favorable with corticosteroids and azathioprine. However, the second case required surgery on 2 occasions with radical nephrectomy. The diagnosis of the latter was made nine years after the onset of symptoms when the biopsy was reviewed; at that moment immunosuppressive therapy was not started. CONCLUSIONS: It is very important to know and diagnose this disease because of the good response to treatment that prevents complications.",0,910
163,"INTRODUCTION: MELAS syndrome -myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes- is a maternally-inherited mitochondrial cytopathy related to several mitochondrial DNA mutations, with the A3243G mutation in tRNA(Leu) gene being the most frequent of them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Apart from its typical symptomatology, patients usually exhibit a maternally-inherited history of neurosensory deafness and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent studies have shown that few patients carrying a A3243G mutation also suffer from renal dysfunction, usually in form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). RESULTS: In this study we examine kidney involvement in 2 unrelated patients with a A3243G mutation by genetic testing. Both have a maternally-inherited neurosensory deafness and insulin-dependent T2DM. A renal biopsy was performed in both patients. One patient developed nephrotic proteinuria and renal insufficiency, with FSGS findings being observed in the kidney biopsy, whereas the other suffered from mild proteinuria and renal insufficiency, with non-specific glomerular changes. CONCLUSION: The presence of FSGS or other kidney involvement accompanied by hereditary neurosensory deafness and T2DM could be suggestive of a A3243G tRNA(Leu) mutation and should prompt a genetic testing and an evaluation of potential extrarenal involvement.",0,1384
164,"Septic arthritis after knee arthroscopy is an extremely rare condition. A rate of 0.15-0.84% cases of postoperative infection is estimated in several series. The arthroscopy procedure most frequently related with an infectious complication is anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, with a prevalence of 0.3-1.7% cases. Staphylococcus sp. is the pathogen most commonly cultured. We describe a case of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction. We found no published case of septic arthritis caused by this microorganism after knee arthroscopy. It is probably the first case published in the literature.",0,611
165,"Adult T cell lymphocyte leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a subtype of T-cell lymphoma caused by infection of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); which generates a pro-viral integration into the host DNA, resulting in a clonal expansion of T lymphocytes. We present the case of a 20-year-old woman who developed multiple lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly and fever, serum positivity for HTLV-1 and proviral integration in the host DNA, demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry of lymphoid node was positive to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ATLL has been described in all HTLV-1 endemic areas, however, there are differences in the mean age of its presentation in such areas: 40 to 50 years in South America, 60 years in Japan. We showed one of few reported cases of the lymphoma type of ATLL in young adults.",0,845
166,"Hydroxychloroquine is used in the long-term therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although considered to be a safe treatment, side effects have been documented. An uncommon side effect is thrombocytopenia. In order to establish the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia secondary to Hydroxychloroquine, non-pharmacological causes must be ruled out and it is necessary to determine a recurrence after re-exposure to the drug. We present one case of severe thrombocytopenia occurring in a patient with SLE undergoing treatment with Hydroxychloroquine.",0,550
167,"OBJECTIVES: Urologists daily evaluate many women with voiding disturbances, but proper physical examination has only rarely been previously performed. CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1: 16-year-old woman presenting augmented daytime urinary frequency and nocturia without enuresis, with drop-by-drop micturition. Case 2: 80-year-old woman with urgency. She referred normal voiding with insensitive urinary loss the hour after. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: adhesion of the labia minora. TREATMENT: Surgical section of the adhered area in the midline was performed with satisfactory aesthetic and clinical results. CONCLUSIONS: The adhesion of the labia minora is an acquired disease, more frequent in girls under 2 years. Several predisposing factors have been proposed: oestrogen deprivation, inadequate personal care, local irritants, infections or previous trauma. Differential diagnosis is required among three congenital pathologies: vaginal agenesis, imperforated hymen and ambiguous genitalia. Cases in postpubertal or postmenopausal women, or refractory to medical treatment are considered for surgery.",0,1093
168,"Dorsal wrist pain is a very common cause of complaint in the clinical practice of the hand surgeon. Such pain can frequently be related to traumatic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases, but sometimes its origin is far away from these common causes. A rare case is reported of chronic dorsal wrist pain of neuropathic origin, due to a pre-capsular neuroma of the posterior interosseous nerve. Possible causes, diagnostic hints, and treatment options are thoroughly discussed.",0,477
169,"INTRODUCTION: IgG4-related disease is a recently described multisystemic clinical entity that can occur with different clinical manifestations. The most often affected organs are the pancreas, bile duct and salivary glands, with unusual central nervous system affection. CASE REPORT: A 33 year old woman who presented with cognitive impairment, hallucinations, headache, convulsive syndrome, maxillary sinus inflammation with bone involvement and evidence of pachymeningitis and panhypopytuirarism with meningeal biopsy that confirmed IgG4-related disease, after ruling out secondary causes. Treatment was started with steroids and azathioprine without relapses after 12 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: IgG4-related disease should be considered in cases of hypertrophic pachymeningitis and hypophysitis especially when no other cause has been found, even if they are not accompanied by other systemic disease manifestations, having ruled out other common causes. The treatment of choice is glucocorticoids and it could be needed to add another immuno-suppressant agent as steroid sparing and to prevent relapses. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the different clinical and paraclinical manifestations and to establish the results of long-term treatment.",0,1262
170,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatic hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign tumor in children, which frequently occurs in the first year of life. The clinical presentation is variable and the diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, and laboratory and imaging studies. The objective was to describe a case of multifocal hepa tic hemangioendothelioma. CLINICAL REPORT: 3-month-old girl who presented hepatomegaly without elements of hepatic or heart failure. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were used to diagnose hepatic hemangioendothelioma, which was confirmed by CT abdominal angiography. The patient received glucocorticoid treatment at high doses for a prolonged period. A year and a half after treatment, there was evidence of tumor remission. She had side effects from the established treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients with isolated hepatomegaly, it should be considered a probable tumor patho logy, considering the clinic and imaging studies. Possible complications and treatments risks must always be assessed. In this case, the tumor extension and its probable complications justified the use of prolonged corticosteroid therapy at high doses despite its adverse effects.",0,1181
171,"BACKGROUND: Primary breast lymphomas, a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, represent 0.04 to 0.5% of all breast cancers, 0.38 to 0.7% of all lymphomas, and 1.7 to 2.2% of extranodal lymphomas. The treatment choice is based on chemotherapy containing anthracycline and rituximab. Surgery is limited to being less invasive and only for diagnostic purposes. Radiotherapy has an important role as consolidation therapy, particularly in patients with negative nodes. CLINICAL CASE: A 70 year old woman with a breast nodule in the left upper outer quadrant, with slow growth, expansive, painless, and accompanied by skin changes, malaise, weight loss, fatigue, chill, and sweating. There was tissue replacement by the mammary gland tumour, skin changes due to invasion, and a 5cm axillary lymphadenopathy. The mammography showed skin thickening and a dense pattern of 80% of breast tissue replacement, and the lymphadenopathy with loss of radiolucent centre and soft tissue invasion. The biopsy confirmed a diffuse high grade large cell lymphoma. She received an Rituximab (R-CHOP) chemotherapy scheme and radiotherapy with tangential and supraclavicular and axillary fields. After completing the chemotherapy, the patient is on follow-up, and at 15 months she is alive without disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Primary lymphoma of the breast is a rare entity. Multimodal treatment with combined chemo-radiotherapy is the cornerstone. Surgery is reserved only for diagnostic purposes.",0,1480
172,"This case concerns an elderly man with a REM sleep behavior disorder, who was initially offered a pharmacological treatment with clonazepam, recommended by other articles, but with poor adherence due to its adverse reactions and persistence of symptoms. He was then offered a treatment with Trazodone was offered, achieving a complete remission of symptoms, with no reported side effects. It is clear that Trazodone has no known indication for this type of disorder; nevertheless, it was considered in this case because of its pharmacological profile, obtaining satisfactory results. Further research is needed in order to document thoroughly the mechanisms of action, efficacy and utility of this molecule in cases such as the one presented.",0,742
173,"OBJECTIVES: 1) to set a reminder of the diagnostic approach to osteoid osteomas (OOs) of the foot; 2) to define the indications of treatment for hindfoot OOs. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 5 OOs were checked (3 cases located in the talus and two cases in calcaneus). The diagnosis was established by clinical and imaging data. In all cases, a calcified nidus was identified on CT, perilesional bone oedema on MRI and focal scintigraphic uptake. Two cases were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and 3 cases with surgical resections: two open surgeries and one arthroscopic surgery. Clinical and oncological outcomes were evaluated at the end of the follow-up. RESULTS: No complications were reported. The clinical outcome was excellent in all cases. One patient was initially treated with open surgery and then subsequently with RFA due to failure of the procedure. There were no recurrences after an average follow-up time of 4 years and 8 months (range, 1-12 years). DISCUSSION: Hindfoot OOs are uncommon and their diagnosis is based on clinical data in conjunction with characteristic imaging findings. Their treatment choices depend on the location of the nidus and relationships with nearby anatomical structures. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of an OO of the hindfoot can be ensured when the epidemiological, clinical and imaging data are compatible with this pathological entity. RFA is indicated for intracortical or cancellous cases in which the nidus is more than 1cm off the skin and significant neurovascular structures. For all other cases an open surgical resection or arthroscopic resection would be the first choice.",0,1628
174,"Intrathecal chemotherapy may be complicated with the development of myelopathies or toxic radiculopathies. This myeloradicular involvement, of toxic character, is unpredictable, since these patients have repeatedly received Intrathecal chemotherapy with the same drugs without apparent injury. The toxic effect should be mainly attributed to Cytarabine and not to methotrexate, since the central nervous system lacks Cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that degrades Cytarabine. We report two patients, an 18-year-old woman and a 16 years old male, who received systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine) for the treatment of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia and developed, in relation to this procedure, a spinal subacute combined degeneration. They had a proprioceptive and motor alteration of the lower extremities and neuroimaging showed selective rear and side spinal cord hyper intensity produced by central axonopathy. Two weeks later the woman developed a quadriplegia and the young man a flaccid paraplegia due to added root involvement.",0,1062
175,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Lynch-like syndrome is diagnosed when there is an expression deficit in DNA mismatch repair proteins but a normal genetic study. The behavior and management of that pathology are currently a subject of debate. We present herein the characteristics of patients with Lynch-like syndrome, together with a surveillance proposal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was carried out on families suspected of presenting with Lynch syndrome. Germline analysis was done if there was loss of mismatch repair protein expression and no BRAF mutation. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients that underwent immunohistochemistry testing, 23 presented with loss of mismatch repair protein expression. Seven of those patients were identified as having Lynch-like syndrome: 3had colon cancer, 2had endometrial tumor, and 2were healthy, with an affected relative. Mean patient age was 56.9 years and only one patient presented with another tumor associated with Lynch syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Until there is a better understanding of the etiology of that heterogeneous entity, intermediate surveillance is an adequate strategy.",0,1127
176,"Marantic or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterized for the presence of vegetations formed by a meshwork of fibrin and other cellular material similar a blood clot, without the presence of microorganisms. It is often related with tumors and chronic inflammatory states. We report a 49 years old female with a history of weight loss and asthenia, presenting with multiple cerebrovascular attacks and fever. Blood cultures were negative and the fever did not subside with antibiotic treatment. Trans esophageal echocardiogram showed a mitral valve vegetation and thickening of the free edge of both leaflets. In search of the etiology of such a case, a primary pancreatic cancer with distant metastases was found. We cannot rule out the differential diagnosis with bacterial endocarditis with negative blood cultures, although the clinical context supports a non-infectious etiology.",0,895
177,"The case concerns a 20 year-old woman with a sudden visual loss in her left eye. In the fundus examination, a focal pre-retinal haemorrhage was observed in the superior temporal vascular branch with accompanying vitreous haemorrhage. There was a favourable spontaneous outcome. Eighteen months later, she presented with a new visual loss in the same eye, showing a sub-hyaloid pre-macular haemorrhage that was satisfactorily drained by hyaloidotomy using a Nd-YAG laser. The patient had also presented with an upper digestive tract haemorrhage and menorrhagia. A haemostasis study was performed that showed a coagulation factor VII deficiency.

178,"Hypertriglyceridemia is common in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A retrospective analysis of the baseline clinical-pathological presentation and treatment outcome (status of lipid profiles) was performed in two children with SLE, who presented with extreme hypertriglyceridemia over a follow-up period of four weeks. The children were treated with prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), hydroxychloroquine and hypolipidemic agents, depending on their disease status. On serial follow-up, the first child showed a significantly raised serum triglyceride level after receiving one week of oral prednisolone therapy. Anti-lipoprotein-lipase (LPL) autoantibody was absent. Lipid profile levels of this child gradually improved after replacing oral prednisolone with another immunosuppressant, namely MMF. The second child presented with extreme hypertriglyceridemia with positive anti-LPL autoantibody. She responded to plasmapheresis followed by increasing the dose of immunosuppressant. So, extreme hypertriglyceridemia in children with SLE may be steroid induced or due to presence of anti-LPL auto antibody. Management should be individualized depending on the etiology.",0,1193
179,"INTRODUCTION: Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, a branch of the radial nerve at the level of the forearm, is characterized by the motor function loss of some or all of the muscles innervated distally. CLINICAL CASE: A 26-year-old male with a history of proximal radius fracture associated to radial nerve injury, treated with osteosynthesis 7 years earlier, with full recovery, who currently presented intense pain 4 cm distal to the radial head, accompanied by paralysis of Extensor pollicis longus, Extesnor pollicis brevis and Abductor pollicis longus, with paresis of the Extensor indicis propius, in which a diagnosis of entrapment syndrome of the anterior descending branch of the posterior interosseous nerve (SNIP) was performed. DISCUSSION: The conservative management of SNIP is indicated during the first 8-12 weeks, if no improvement is found, the indication for surgical exploration is indicated, and the removal of osteosynthesis material is controversial.",0,975
180,"CASES REPORT: Two patients presented with headache and bilateral papillary edema. Patient 1 was found to have a papilledema (P) with intracranial pressure of 32cmH2O. Patient 2 was found to have a migraine with a pseudopapilledema (PP) (optic nerve head drusen). SD-OCT was used to image the optic disc, subretinal hypore fl ective space (SHS), and alpha-angle (Aalpha). DISCUSSION: Optic disc SD-OCT may be useful for differentiating disc morphology in P and PP. The area of the SHS and the Aalpha were higher in the P patient than in the patient with PP.",0,556
181,"CLINICAL CASE: A 33-year-old male diagnosed with Parinaud's syndrome, exotropia and post-papillary oedema optic atrophy in his left eye. A pineal germinoma was diagnosed after performing neuroimaging scans and a stereotactic biopsy. He was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, showing a complete pathological response. The Parinaud's syndrome persists one year after diagnosis and the patient has refused to have strabismus surgery. DISCUSSION: Parinaud's syndrome consists of a supranuclear vertical gaze palsy resulting from damage to the midbrain tectum. The involvement of adjacent structures leads to the <<Parinaud-plus>> syndrome. When a Parinaud's syndrome is accompanied by diplopia (<<Parinaud-plus>> syndrome), extension of the injury into adjacent areas must be considered.",0,792
182,"This article describes the pathological studies of fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a 73-year-old man during an outbreak of SARS in Taiwan, 2003. Eight days before onset of symptoms, he visited a municipal hospital that was later identified as the epicenter of a large outbreak of SARS. On admission to National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei, the patient experienced chest tightness, progressive dyspnea, and low-grade fever. His condition rapidly deteriorated with increasing respiratory difficulty, and he died 7 days after admission. The most prominent histopathologic finding was diffuse alveolar damage of the lung. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization assays demonstrated evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in various respiratory epithelial cells, predominantly type II pneumocytes, and in alveolar macrophages in the lung. Electron microscopic examination also revealed coronavirus particles in the pneumocytes, and their identity was confirmed as SARS-CoV by immunogold labeling electron microscopy. This report is the first to describe the cellular localization of SARS-CoV in human lung tissue by using a combination of immunohistochemistry, double-stain immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, and immunogold labeling electron microscopy. These techniques represent valuable laboratory diagnostic modalities and provide insights into the pathogenesis of this emerging infection.",1,1474
183,"Arterial pseudoaneurysm of the lower limb is an infrequent entity, particularly in the infrapopliteal segment. It is commonly associated to vascular repairs or follows a localized arterial lesion, a fracture or a surgical procedure. There is little information in Mexico about this entity in cases involving the anterior tibial artery, and secondary to trauma and osteosynthesis. Given that sudden bleeding due to rupture of the pseudoaneurysm is a possible catastrophic outcome for the viability of the segment, it is important to timely detect and diagnose the pseudoaneurysm. Treatment indications contained in the international literature are controversial. Solution-oriented approaches may be either surgical or endovascular. Current reports show that the best treatment option is an autologous saphenous vein graft, which maintains blood flow and minimizes the risk of peripheral ischemia. The purpose of this paper is to report the case of a patient who sustained the above mentioned complication and provide a literature review. This topic should be further investigated, as this condition may go unnoticed in a large number of cases, given that its symptoms are silent.",0,1178
184,"Symptomatic cobalt toxicity from a failed total hip replacement is a rare, but devastating complication. Potential clinical findings include cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, skin rash, visual and hearing impairment, polycythaemia, weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and neuropathy. The case is presented of a 74year-old man in whom, after a ceramic-ceramic replacement and two episodes of prosthetic dislocation, it was decided to replace it with a polyethylene-metal total hip arthroplasty (THA). At 6months after the revision he developed symptoms of cobalt toxicity, confirmed by analytical determination (serum cobalt level=651.2mug/L). After removal of the prosthesis, the levels of chromium and cobalt in blood and urine returned to normal, with the patient currently being asymptomatic. It is recommended to use a new ceramic on ceramic bearing at revision, in order to minimise the risk of wear-related cobalt toxicity following breakage of ceramic components.",0,973
185,"Acute hepatitis due to the hepatitis A virus usually has a short, benign and self-limited course, without causing chronic hepatitis. However, some cases have an atypical presentation, such as relapsing hepatitis, prolonged or persistent cholestasis, fulminant hepatic failure, or liver failure associated with autoimmune hepatitis. The typical clinical course of acute hepatitis A virus infection is spontaneous remission in 90% of the cases, but atypical cases have a prevalence that varies from less than 1 to 20%, depending on the manifestation (overall prevalence approximately 7%). There is little information on the atypical clinical courses of hepatitis A virus infection and the lack of recognizing those presentations in clinical practice often results in carrying out numerous studies and treatments that not only are unnecessary, but can also be harmful. The aim of the present article was to describe 3 clinical cases of atypical hepatitis A infection and provide a literature review of such cases.",0,1010
186,"Neisseria subflava belongs to Neisseriaceae family, is considered a comensal specie, however in certain host, mainly inmunosuppresed patientes and children, the literature has documented invasive infections. We present a case of a bacteriemia due to N. subflava in a newborn, treated with cefotaxime with good outcome. In newborns, the most common Neisseria bacteria to cause invasive infections are N. meningitidis, with highly fatal clinical course and N. gonorrhoeae which compromise the eye, oftalmia neonatorum, with uncommon invasive infections.

187,"CLINICAL CASE: A 22 year-old woman complained about blurred vision after an episode of recovered cardiorespiratory arrest. She had bilateral low visual acuity (<<count fingers>>) and no ophthalmological or visual pathways changes. She also had an apparent lack of awareness of the deficit. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed ischaemic changes in both occipital lobes. As a result, she was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. DISCUSSION: This is a rare disease that should be suspected in strange or poorly congruent visual loss. It is usually due to an ischaemic injury in this region of brain, manifesting itself with low vision not perceived by the patient (visual confabulation). It can simulate a non-organic visual loss or psychiatric disease.",0,761
188,"The literature on peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum (PPD) is scarce, and studies to date have included few patients. It is therefore difficult to determine the incidence of PPD, investigate risk factors, or evaluate the effectiveness of the different treatments available. We report on a series of 4 patients diagnosed with PPD at our hospital in 2013 and 2014, and review the clinical characteristics and responses to treatment. Three of the patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 1 had rectal cancer. Three patients responded favorably to initial treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment (administered as monotherapy in 2 cases and combined with immunosuppressants in the other).

189,"Renal disease secondary to vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can lead to chronic renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. In these patients, kidney transplantation offers excellent long-term rates of allograft and patient survival; consequently, they can be trasplanted when the clinical disease activity has remitted. However, the risk of disease relapses in the renal allograft remains, although at lower rates due to modern immunosuppressive regimens. We describe the case of a male patient with extracapillary glomerulonephritis type III C-ANCA (+) who developed a recurrence in the renal allograft 8 years after transplantation. Intensive immunosupression with plasmapheresis controlled the disease.",0,753
190,"PURPOSE: To report the case of a young woman with retinal vein occlusion and prothrombin heterozygous mutation, and to review the current evidence on the systematic study in cases of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in young patients. METHODS: Eligible articles were identified using a comprehensive literature search of PubMed. CONCLUSION: RVO risk factors may have different relevance depending on each age group. In the systematic study of cases in young patients, it is recommended to look for ""emerging"" risk factors, bilateral involvement, or absence of ""classic"" risk factors.",0,579
191,"The recent introduction of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) offers pregnant women a more accurate method than traditional serum screening methods for detecting fetal aneuploidies. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of NIPT for Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes. However NIPT approaches that take advantage of single-nucelotide polymorphism (SNP) information potentially allow the identification of triploidy, chromosomal microdeletion syndromes and other unusual genetic variants. To highlight this approach of NIPT we present a rare case of confined placental X chromosome monosomy mosaicism that was prenatally suspected with a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based noninvasive prenatal test. The results of invasive tests (amniocentesis) showed small proportion of X chromosome mosaicism (45, X[5]/46, XX[95]). After birth karyotype of the girl revealed no abnormalities (46 XX), confirming that mosaicism was limited to the placenta. These results highlight the need of patient's informed consent and thorough pretest and postest counseling to ensure that they understand the limitations and advantages of the tests and the implications of the resultss.",0,1199
192,"PURPOSE: To determine the number of patients diagnosed over a 5-year period with isolated occlusion of the cilioretinal artery (CRAO) whilst pregnant, as well as to describe the outcomes and ophthalmological sequelae of this condition in pregnant woman. METHODS: A retrospective study of the medical records. RESULTS: From the 135 patients diagnosed with retinal arterial occlusion of all of our series, 20 (14.8%) had CRAO, and 2 (1.48%) of these were pregnant. Case 1: A 34 year-old pregnant woman with a centrocaecal scotoma and visual acuity of 20/20 in right eye. Fundus examination: A soft exudate in the papillomacular bundle with retinal oedema and embolism on a cilioretinal artery branch. The exudate and oedema disappeared after 5 weeks, and the scotoma was reduced. Case 2: A 30 year-old pregnant woman, with normal visual acuity in right eye, and a centrocaecal scotoma. Fundoscopy: An area of retinal interpapillomacular infarction due to cilioretinal artery occlusion. The fundus returned to normal in 4 weeks, with an improvement of the scotoma. CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology of CRAO is usually associated with carotid disease or other thromboembolic events related to hypercoagulable states and autoimmunity. Pregnancy is considered a hypercoagulable state, and it is not known if it is a risk factor for arterial embolism. Further studies are required to determine the correlation between pregnancy and CRAO.",0,1423
193,"The case is presented of a post-lung transplant patient, ASA III, proposed for orchiectomy due to testicular cancer. A combination of iliohypogastric (ILH), ilioinguinal (ILI) and genitofemoral (GF) nerve block together with sedation was used as anaesthetic technique. The inguinal area received sensory innervation mainly from ILI, ILH and GF nerves. The genital branch of the GF nerve supplies innervation to skin of the anterosuperior portion of the scrotum. When performing the echo-guided block of GF nerve, it is necessary to identify the spermatic cord, and administer the local anaesthetic on the inside and periphery of the cord. Peripheral nerve blocks are a valid option for complex patients. Its main advantage is the anaesthesia and analgesia level that it provides without the haemodynamic instability associated with general or neuraxial anaesthesia. GF nerve block provides hemi-scrotal anaesthesia, allowing manipulation and intervention in the inguinal-scrotal area, complementing the anaesthesia provided by ILI and ILH nerve blocks.",0,1052
194,"CASE REPORT: we present an 85-year-old patient with polydipsia, polyuria and severe hypertriglyceridemia of 27 years of evolution, without pancreatitis, resistant to dietary and pharmacological treatments. He was diagnosed of hyperglycerolemia due to glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) based on: transparent non-lipemic serum, with glycerol increase in plasma and urine, without glycerol 3 phosphate increase, and a deletion, not previously described, in the glycerol kinase gene. DISCUSSION: a correct dietary treatment with frequent meals and rich in complex carbohydrates, without medication, improved the symptomatology.",0,622
195,"Normoglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis should be suspected in pregnant women presenting nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. We report a 39 years old woman with a 32 weeks pregnancy who sought emergency care due to hyperemesis. She was hospitalized with the following diagnoses: pregnancy hypertension syndrome, gestational diabetes, morbid obesity and poor prenatal control. The evaluation of the feto-placental unit showed perception of fetal movements, non-reactive non-stress baseline record and a biophysical profile of 6/8. Fetal maturation was initiated. Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, a low pH, an increased Gap anion, elevated ketonemia and a blood glucose of 172 mg/dl. A diagnosis of normoglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis was formulated and treatment with hydration and regular insulin according to capillary blood glucose levels was started. An emergency caesarean section was performed. The newborn weighed 2.650 kg, had a length of 46 cm, was large for gestational age, had an Apgar score of 2.7, had perinatal asphyxia, convulsive syndrome and a possible congenital cardiopathy. Once the ketoacidosis was resolved during the immediate puerperium, slow acting insulin was initiated.",0,1216
196,"We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman with a seropositive, erosive, and non-nodular rheumatoid arthritis of 15 year of evolution. The patient had poor compliance with medical visits and treatment. She came to the clinic with persistent pancytopenia and spleen and liver enlargement. Liver and bone marrow biopsies were carried out and amyloidosis, neoplasias and infections were ruled out. We discuss the differential diagnosis of pancytopenia and spleen and liver enlargement in a long-standing rheumatoid arthritis patient.",0,531
197,"Nephronia or focal acute nephritis corresponds to a localized inflammatory non-liquefactive kidney infection which may involve parenchyma of one or more renal lobes. It has been suggested that nephronia is part of the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis and renal abscess. It is associated with a prolonged clinical course, higher levels of inflammatory markers and an increased risk of renal scarring, compared to pyelonephritis. Ultrasound plays a useful role. Nephronia is an under-diagnosed condition, thus, clinical suspicion is important for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We present three paediatric cases, and a review of the literature.",0,693
198,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease occasionally associated with severe extra-articular manifestations, mostly in cases of longstanding highly active disease. We report the case of a 56 year-old woman diagnosed with active RA at the age of 40. After 5 years of high activity, her arthritis subsides spontaneously during pregnancy despite the lack of treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. She remains without articular symptoms for 7 years, and then she develops a Felty's syndrome requiring steroid treatment and splenectomy. Following steroid withdrawal she develops pericarditis with massive serohematic pericardial effusion, still in absence of articular activity, and responds to immunosuppressive therapy and colchicine. We emphasize the unusual spontaneous and sustained joint remission without specific treatment, and the development of severe extra-articular manifestations of RA in absence of concomitant articular activity, as well as the importance of controlling inflammation.",0,1040
199,"CASE REPORT: A patient with a history of surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma presented with involvement of both the left facial nerve and the left trigeminal nerve. She initially consulted for exposure keratitis, but two weeks later presented with an infectious keratitis. After taking the corneal sample, she presented with persistent epithelial defect, which did not respond to medical management. Topical insulin was indicated, and a decrease in the area of the lesion was seen in the following 5 days. A therapeutic contact lens was also placed at that time and finally, two weeks after the initiation of insulin, the epithelial defect completely closed. DISCUSSION: This was a complex case due to the confluence of facial paralysis, neurotrophic keratitis, and infectious keratitis, which finally had a successful outcome. Topical insulin can be an effective adjuvant therapy in cases of neurotrophic ulcers that do not respond to standard therapy.",0,959
200,"There are few published data available about simultaneous bilateral hip fractures. We present the case of a 56-year-old man with Down syndrome and Alzheimer-like dementia with simultaneous bilateral hip fracture. A bilateral partial hip cemented arthroplasty was performed on this patient. The aim was to avoid the partial burden that could be caused by ostheosynthesis, due to the patient's lack of cooperation arising from his mental deterioration and his problems realizing everyday activities. He was able to walk unaided with complete autonomy until his death fourth years later. In our experience, one stage surgery for bilateral hip prosthesis is safe and provides good results in patients with severe mental impairment.",0,727
201,"HIV infection has different clinical presentations. We report a 21-year-old male with longstanding isolated microscopic hematuria attributed to thin glomerular basement membrane disease, who after 15 years of follow-up presented with significant proteinuria. A kidney biopsy was performed, revealing the presence of tubulo-reticular inclusions in the glomerular endothelial cells. This finding led to suspect an HIV infection, which was verified. Antiretroviral therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor blockers were prescribed. At 6 years of diagnosis the patient is asymptomatic and has normal kidney function. Microscopic hematuria and low level proteinuria persists.",0,696
202,"Small cell carcinoma of ovary-hypercalcemic type is an undifferentiated carcinoma. We describe two cases in women aged 32 and 29. Both presented with large masses and complete surgical extirpation was impossible. Histologically, the images were similar, with diffuse cell proliferation, accompanied by the presence of follicle-like spaces. In both cases it was necessary to make a differential diagnosis with entities such as adult or juvenile granulosa cell tumour, small cell carcinoma of pulmonary type, dysgerminoma and even peripheral neuroectodermal tumour. The absence of SMARCA4/BRG1 immunostaining proved very useful in the diagnosis of hypercalcemic small cell ovarian carcinoma.",0,689
203,"Congenital tracheo-or-bronchobiliary fistula or congenital he-patopulmonary fistula is a rare malformation with high morbidity and mortality if the diagnosis is not made early. The tracheo-or-bronchobiliary fistula is a communication between the respiratory (trachea or bronchus) and biliary tract. To date, only 35 cases have been published worldwide. We report a case of a neonate with right pneumonia and bilious fluid in the endotracheal tube. Diagnosis was made using bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy. Videothoracoscopy was used to remove the bronchobiliary fistula. Subsequently, a left he-patectomy with Roux-en-Y biliary-digestive anastomosis was performed as bile ductus hypoplasia was present.",0,700
204,"IgG4-related disease is a heterogeneous group of diseases that can affect a single organ or manifest as a systemic disease. We present the case of a 55-yearold female, admitted for dry cough, fever, progressive dyspnea and respiratory failure. Chest CT showed areas of diffuse ground glass, reticular pattern and alveolar consolidation. She received treatment for community acquired pneumonia and systemic corticosteroids with good response. One month later, she was admitted again due to subglottic stenosis, progression of pulmonary infiltrates, and increased palpebral and submaxillary glands volume. Transbronchial and salivary gland biopsies showed infiltration by IgG4. Increased levels of plasma IgG4 were also detected. Immunosuppressive therapy was given with good response.",0,783
205,"No Typhoid Salmonella infection is one of the most common and widely spread foodborne diseases worldwide. Although most cases are limited to the gastrointestinal tract, extraintestinal involvement is not uncommon. However, adenitis as an isolated manifestation, is an unusual form of the disease. We report a case of Salmonella no Typhoid cervical lymphadenitis in a 67-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, who was treated with surgery and ciprofloxacin.",0,479
206,"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 as an important respiratory disease with high fatality rates of 40%-60%. Despite the increased number of cases over subsequent years, the number of pediatric cases remained low. A review of studies conducted from June 2012 to April 19, 2016 reported 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases. In this paper, we present the clinical and laboratory features of seven patients with pediatric MERS. Five patients had no underlying medical illnesses, and three patients were asymptomatic. Of the seven cases, four (57%) patients sought medical advice within 1-7 days from the onset of symptoms. The three other patients (43%) were asymptomatic and were in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (57%), cough (14%), shortness of breath (14%), vomiting (28%), and diarrhea (28%). Two (28.6%) patients had platelet counts of < 150 x 10(9)/L, and one patient had an underlying end-stage renal disease. The remaining patients presented with normal blood count, liver function, and urea and creatinine levels. The documented MERS-CoV Ct values were 32-38 for four of the seven cases. Two patients (28.6%) had abnormal chest radiographic findings of bilateral infiltration. One patient (14.3%) required ventilator support, and two patients (28.6%) required oxygen supplementation. All the seven patients were discharged without complications.",1,1471
207,"The larval form of the moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa, known as pine processionary caterpillar, is one of the main forest pests in southern Europe. Often, these caterpillars cause local reactions in humans, due to their microscopic stinging hairs. Most symptoms affect skin, in form of acute urticaria. Systemic reactions are rare. An eleven month old infant with a systemic reaction after ingestion of a pine processionary caterpillar is presented. The boy reached the Emergency Room with orofacial edema, drooling and urticaria. Drug treatment was enough to resolve the symptoms. The patient did not present airway commitment, nor anaphylaxis data at any moment, so more aggressive actions, such as endotracheal intubation, endoscopy or laryngoscopy, were rejected.",0,765
208,"Since mid-March 2014, the frequency with which cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported has increased, with the majority of recent cases reported from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition, the frequency with which travel-associated MERS cases have been reported and the number of countries that have reported them to the World Health Organization (WHO) have also increased. The first case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was reported to CDC by the Indiana State Department of Health on May 1, 2014, and confirmed by CDC on May 2. A second imported case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler from Saudi Arabia having no connection with the first case, was reported to CDC by the Florida Department of Health on May 11, 2014. The purpose of this report is to alert clinicians, health officials, and others to increase awareness of the need to consider MERS-CoV infection in persons who have recently traveled from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. This report summarizes recent epidemiologic information, provides preliminary descriptions of the cases reported from Indiana and Florida, and updates CDC guidance about patient evaluation, home care and isolation, specimen collection, and travel as of May 13, 2014.",1,1372
209,"BACKGROUND: Tumour markers are substances produced by the tumour itself, or by the host in response to a tumour. These markers could be measured either in the blood or in body secretions. One of the most common tumour markers used in gastrointestinal diseases is Ca 19-9. It is the marker most used for pancreatic cancer, but can be elevated in many benign processes. Thus, it is not a specific marker. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a male patient with 4 years of moderate abdominal pain, weight loss, and persistent elevation of Ca 19-9. After an extensive work-up, renal and hepatic cysts were found, as well as steatosis and, apparently, a gallbladder polyp. With these findings and the persistent elevation of Ca 19-9, it was decided to operate the patient. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed showing multiple, yellowish nodular lesions all over the hepatic surface suggestive of metastases, as well as simple hepatic cysts. Pathology reported biliary hamartomas, steatosis, and chronic cholecystitis. After 2years of follow up, although there is no evidence of malignant neoplasia, there is still an elevation of Ca 19-9. CONCLUSION: The persistent elevation of Ca 19-9 is probably due to the presence of multiple benign diseases such as steatosis, urolithiasis, hepatic and renal cysts, and cholecystitis. An algorithm is needed for healthy patients with elevated levels of Ca 19-9 marker, in order to lower costs, avoid misdiagnoses, and improve management.",0,1480
210,"The bluish coloration of skin and mucous membranes, called as cyanosis, could be explained by high reduced hemoglobin in the capillaries, or the presence of elevated methemoglobin concentration. It is important to think of methemoglobinemia as a differential diagnosis in a cyanotic patient who does not respond to oxygen administration once cardiorespiratory causes are discarded; since it requires other diagnostic methods and specific treatment. We described a case of cyanosis in a fourteen-year-old adolescent with probable congenital methemoglobinemia. We discussed their probable causes, clinic presentation, diagnosis and treatment.",0,640
211,"INTRODUCTION: pemphigus vulgaris is a serious and infrequent disease in children. Its timely diagnosis and treatment allows modifying its prognosis. The objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, and the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of this uncommon autoimmune blistering disease in children. CLINICAL CASE: 2-year-old male patient, previously healthy. He initially presented generalized dermatosis with maximum lesion areas at the umbilical region, limbs and genitals; characterized by blisters, some denuded, and of easy bleeding, without mucosal involvement nor fever. Bullous impetigo was diagnosed and topical and systemic antibiotic treatment was started, showing no clinical improvement. He developed extension of the lesions with oral and anal mucosal involvement. The histologic and direct immunofluorescent study of lesions and perilesional skin confirm the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient started treatment with corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents with good clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the similarity with other more prevalent infectious and inflammatory diseases, a high index of suspicion is required in order to avoid delays in the diagnosis and the start of treatment. In patients with blisters with an unexpected clinical evolu tion, it is necessary to conduct a joint evaluation with a dermatologist and to assess the opportunity of performing a biopsy of the lesion and perilesional skin for histological study and direct immunofluo rescence, which will allow diagnostic confirmation.",0,1553
212,"Primary orbital squamous cell carcinoma is a rare entity. There is little published literature. We report a case of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the orbital soft tissues. Surgical resection offered the best treatment for the patient. Complete resection of the lesion was achieved. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy due to the proximity of the lesion to the surgical margins. Surgical treatment is feasible and should be considered as part of the surgeon's arsenal. However, therapeutic decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis.",0,548
213,"In the last few years, the existence of a clinical profile similar to celiac disease has become important; this disease does not adapt to the traditional diagnosis canons. It is related to a number of patients who are diagnosed as having the celiac disease but present normal serology and small bowel's biopsy. Since the 80's, medical literature reports the existence of a syndrome that connects gluten diet with a toxic effect that produces gastrointestinal symptoms even though the mucosa remains normal. This disease is called the Cooper-Cook syndrome. Over the last few years, there have been lots of publications about this disease under the name ""gluten sensitivity"". In the following article, three clinical cases that refer to this condition are presented.",0,764
214,"An asymptomatic 24-year-old woman underwent a colposcopy, cervical biopsy, and subsequently, a conization for a cervical squamous cell carcinoma in situ with glandular extension. Simultaneously, an endometrial biopsy was carried out in which, incidentally, a placental site nodule was diagnosed, a rare non-neoplastic lesion originating in the intermediate trophoblast. Given the coexistence of these two entities, it was necessary to make a differential diagnosis between them and also with other pathologies of the trophoblast such as an exaggerated placental site, placental site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor.",0,640
215,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the colon is a rare and very aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. The current case report presents a 53-year-old male with a 6 cm x 10 cm ascending colon carcinoma, causing large intestine obstruction, with simultaneous multiple hepatic metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Surgical resection of the primary tumor was performed, because of the bowel obstruction, to ameliorate the symptoms before the onset of chemotherapy. Histopathology revealed that the tumor was a small-cell undifferentiated NEC. During the post0operative period, the patient presented pulmonary metastases, and on the 36th post-operative day, death occurred due to respiratory failure.",0,698
216,"Foreign bodies in esophagus are avoidable accidents that occur most often in children younger than 3 years. The most common presenting symptoms are dysphagia, drooling and vomiting. Occasionally a foreign body in the esophagus may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, stridor and respiratory distress. This is more common in young children and when the object remains lodged in the esophagus for a prolonged period. Clinical suspicion is essential for early diagnosis, which allows to avoid potential complications. We describe 3 children with a foreign body impacted in the esophagus who presented mainly respiratory symptoms. We alert pediatricians on symptomatic variation in the presentation of a foreign body ingestion and we underline the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.",0,801
217,"Although gastrointestinal symptoms are not rare in Systemic lupus erythematosus, enteritis is an atypical manifestation of the disease. We report a 54 year-old woman who presented acute symptoms of diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain, receiving empiric antibiotic therapy for bacterial enteritis with no response. Computed tomography showed diffuse small intestine inflammation and serositis. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro and anti-La were positive on blood tests. A lupic enteropathy was diagnosed and steroid treatment was initiated, with subsequent clinical improvement.",0,574
218,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During a community methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization study, an MRSA strain with vancomycin hetero-resistance (h-VISA) was isolated from a five year-old girl with tetralogy of Fallot without previous exposure to vancomycin. An extended nasal colonization study was performed on all her close relatives. RESULTS: Only the patient and her sister were colonized by an h-VISA MRSA strain (clone USA 700, ST72, t148, agr 1 and SCCmec IVa). Mupirocin decolonisation was effective in the elder sister. A new nasal decolonisation in the younger girl using fusidic acid was also successful. However, after decolonisation both sisters were colonized by a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (ST30, t012 and agr 3) previously isolated from their mother's nostrils. CONCLUSION: As S. aureus have a great capacity to spread among people in close contact, knowledge of a patients' colonization status, tracing contacts, and a correct management are critical issues for the successful containment of multiresistant staphylococci.",0,1074
219,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Itraconazole is an antifungal imidazole used for the treatment of aspergillosis. Evidence supporting the association between itraconazole and the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF) is limited and is based on cases reported after drug market release. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 76-year-old man with hypertension and COPD GOLD D who experienced heart failure after receiving a new line of treatment with itraconazole. The patient's symptoms resolved completely after the drug's withdrawal and initiation of treatment with diuretic therapy. Using validated algorithms, we concluded that there was a probable association between itraconazole and the onset of CHF. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the administration of itraconazole and the onset of CHF is difficult to prove. Further observational studies are needed to assess this association. However, based on the available evidence, we should consider this possible adverse effect and even contraindicate this treatment in patients with a structural heart disease.",0,1061
220,"Exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP) is a rare (incidence 1.0%-2.5%), often under-diagnosed disease, caused by the aspiration and accumulation of exogenous lipids within the pulmonary alveoli. Various cases have been described due to inhalation of lubricants via the nasal passages and oropharynx, aspiration of mineral oils in laxatives in patients with eating disorders, application of lip gloss, occupational exposure to liquid paraffin or mineral oils (""fire-eaters"", industrial use in washing of machinery, automobile workshops, plastic paints, etc.) and application of Vaseline during the insertion of nasogastric tubes and in the care of tracheotomy patients. ELP usually presents radiologically as areas of low-attenuation peribronchial consolidation and ground glass opacities, with a predominantly bibasal distribution. We present 5 cases of long-standing laryngectomy patients diagnosed with ELP who admitted using Vaseline in their tracheal stoma care.",0,960
221,"Coccydynia is a syndrome that rheumatologists encounter frequently in the form of tailbone pain, which is usually worse when sitting. Although the most common origin is trauma, there are several other possible causes of pain in the coccyx. We present an unusual case in which coccydynia developed shortly after the insertion of a contraceptive vaginal ring and remitted completely upon removal of this system.",0,409
222,"Hip pain in the young adult is a disabling pathophysiological process may be related to multiple etiologies. The process must be determined in order to make a diagnosis and follow-up treatment. The case is presented of a 29 year old woman with anemia, atraumatic hip pain on the right side, and a limp of one month onset.

223,"INTRODUCTION: Occipital condyle syndrome consists of the presence of unilateral occipital headache exacerbated by moving the head and is accompanied by paralysis of the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve. One of its causes is infiltration of the base of the skull by bone metastases, especially those affecting the hypoglossal nerve due to infiltration as it passes through the osseous canal. CASE REPORTS: We report two clinical cases of occipital condyle syndrome secondary to metastatic hepatocarcinoma. The first is that of a 52-year-old male with liver cirrhosis secondary to liver pathology caused by hepatitis C virus with occipital condyle syndrome as the presenting symptom in disseminated hepatocarcinoma. The second case is that of a 56-year-old male after recurrence of hepatocarcinoma following a liver transplant, despite not fulfilling the Milan criteria. CONCLUSION: Occipital condyle syndrome is an alarm symptom and requires a thorough study by means of imaging tests, since it may be the first symptom of an undetected hepatocarcinoma.",0,1049
224,"Dermabacter hominis species is constituted by Gram positive facultative anaerobic coryneform rods being part of the resident microbiota human skin, and exceptionally associated to infections in immunocompromised or severely debilitated patients. An immunocompetent young adult woman with a neck sebaceous cyst infected by D. hominis as unique etiologic agent is presented. Phenotypic identification of the causative agent was achieved through simple tests, based on the originally scheme proposed by Funke and Bernard, and feasible to be performed in a hospital Microbiology Laboratory. Phenotypic characteristics as coccoid morphology, the acrid/spermatic odor, esculin hydrolysis, the production of pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylase, are key tests to identify D. hominis. The matrix-asisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) confirmed the phenotypic identification.",0,936
225,"Arterial involvement in Behcet's disease (BD) is less common than venous lesions. The most commonly affected arteries are: the aorta, lower extremity arteries, mesenteric, femoral, coronary, renal, subclavian and pulmonary arteries. The rupture of pulmonary arteries is the main cause of death of patients with EB and the presence of aneurysms is a bad prognostic factor. We report two patients with arterial involvement in BD. A 14 years old male presenting with hemoptysis lasting three days. A chest computed tomography showed an aneurismal dilatation of the right interlobar artery, bilateral intramural thrombi and alveolar hemorrhage. A right lobar pulmonary resection was performed but hemoptysis recurred. Suspecting a BD, prednisone was started and hemoptysis subsided. A 42 years old male presenting with chest pain and hemoptysis. A chest CT scan showed thrombi in pulmonary veins and anticoagulant therapy was started. Two months later he was admitted again due to a massive hemoptysis. The CT scan showed aneurisms in pulmonary arteries, mural thrombi and pulmonary infarction. With the diagnosis of BD, methylprednisolone, followed by prednisone and cyclophosphamide were used, with a good clinical response.",0,1222
226,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent gallstone ileus is an uncommon mechanical intestinal obstruction secondary to occlusion of the intestine by an intraluminal biliary calculus. CLINICAL CASE: Female, 75 years old, ischaemic heart disease (stent), arrived in our department complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. Computed tomography showed gallstone ileus. The patient underwent an enterotomy with gallstone removal. Three months later, the patient came back with the same clinical symptoms and signs. A new computed tomography highlighted a gallstone ileus again. Enterolithotomy and gallstone removal, cholecystectomy and closure of cholecystoduodenal fistula were performed. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay due to the development of congestive heart failure. Case 2. Male, 71 years old, ischaemic heart disease and aortocoronary bypass, seen in our department complaining of vomiting. Computed tomography showed aerobilia and gallstone ileus. The patient underwent an urgent enterolithotomy. Seven months later, the patient came back with the same clinical symptoms and signs. Computed tomography showed a new gallstone ileus. An enterotomy and gallstone removal, cholecystectomy and closure of cholecystoduodenal fistula were performed. The patient died due to multi-organ failure in post-surgery period. CONCLUSION: In the elderly patients with concomitant medical illnesses with the risk of a second laparotomy, it is justifiable to reconsider the definitive repair in the treatment of gallstone ileus. The enterolithotomy in acute phase followed by early cholecystectomy (4-8 weeks) may be a safe method for eliminating, not only the possibility of recurrent gallstone ileus, and probably the need for a second laparotomy, but also the exceptional possibility of developing a gallbladder carcinoma.",0,1806
227,"CLINICAL CASE: A 46-year-old woman with no relevant medical history, native of Honduras and resident in Spain for one and a half months. The patient went to the Emergency Department due to inflammation of the upper eyelid of the right eye, with an area that simulated an abscess. This was drained (obtaining hardly any purulent content). Treatment was prescribed with oral and topical antibiotics, as well as an anti-inflammatory drug. One week later the patient returned, with improvement of the inflammatory signs, but with discomfort and corneal erosions. After eversion of the upper eyelid, a <<worm>> type parasite emerged from the tarsus. The extraction was completed with a clamp, and was later identified as Dermatobia hominis (Dh) by examination of a fresh specimen. The subsequent outcome of the patient was favourable. DISCUSSION: Preseptal cellulitis in patients from tropical and sub-tropical areas can be caused by Dh.",0,932
228,"INTRODUCTION: Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS) is a rare but potentially lethal adverse reaction secondary to the continuous intravenous infusion of this drug. The diagnosis is based on the com bination of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hepatomegaly, renal failure, hyperli pidemia, arrhythmias, and rapidly progressive heart failure. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of PRIS and literature review. CLINICAL CASE: A 6-year-old female patient with history of epilepsy secondary to large malformation of cortical development of the right hemisphere. The patient presented a refractory status epilepticus that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for life support and treatment, which included continuous intravenous infusion of propofol at 10 mg/kg/h. She developed hemo dynamic instability, and after 24 h of treatment an increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, metabolic acidosis and elevated lactacidemia were observed. After ruling out other causes, PRIS was diagnosed; therefore, the drug was suspended, achieving hemodynamic stabilization after 24 hours. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of PRIS is complex and should be considered in patients who are receiving this drug and present metabolic acidosis or heart failure. The factors that most influence mortality are the cumulative dose of the drug, the presence of fever, and cranial brain injury. In the case described, the patient received a dose higher than 4 mg/kg/h, which is the maximum recommended dose, and responded favorably 12 hours after stopping the drug.",0,1549
229,"Renal-coloboma syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by renal hypodysplasia and coloboma. A case of a 12-year-old girl with chronic kidney disease, bilateral optic nerve colobomas and an exceptional PAX-2 gene mutation is presented. Diagnosed in prenatal scans with bilateral renal hypoplasia, she presented clinical and laboratory findings of chronic kidney disease at 5 days of life. Following tests showed grade II bilateral vesicoureteral reflux spontaneously solved, maintained non nephrotic proteinuria controlled with enalapril and bilateral colobomas with left macular atrophy. Renal function remained stable. Genetic study showed de novo and non sense mutation p.R104X in heterocygosis. Currently there are 80 published cases of renal-coloboma syndrome associated with this gene mutations. Ophthalmologic and genetic evaluations are crucial in cases affected by renal hypodysplasia. Renal function will establish prognosis. We review the etiopathogenesis of this disease.",0,998
230,"CASE REPORT: Bilateral Acute Iris Transillumination (BAIT) is a disease characterised by bilateral acute, severe pigment dispersion of the iris, and pupil sphincter paralysis. The case is reported of a 51-year-old female who was diagnosed with BAIT syndrome, with refractory ocular hypertension in the left eye, and who needed filtering surgery. Aqueous misdirection was developed a week after surgery, then pars plana vitrectomy was performed and the complication was solved. CONCLUSION: This is the first case described in literature of aqueous humor misdirection syndrome secondary to glaucoma filtering surgery in a patient diagnosed of BAIT syndrome. This is a recently defined disease with a few cases currently described.",0,728
231,"OBJECTIVE: Cases of giant renal angiomyolipoma (>9cm) are a therapeutic challenge due to their low frequency and large size. The treatment objective for patients with renal angiomyolipoma should be complete tumour extirpation, with a nephron-sparing surgical technique, without complications and using a minimally invasive approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 3 cases of giant angiomyolipoma (10 12 and 14cm) treated with a combined approach: superselective embolisation and subsequent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, in 3 separate hospitals. RESULTS: None of the cases required conversion to open surgery. One of the 3 patients underwent arterial clamping, and none of the patients had complications. CONCLUSIONS: The combined approach provides a procedure with the criteria of minimal invasiveness, nephron sparing, little bleeding and reduced warm ischaemia time.",0,874
232,"INTRODUCTION: Craniopharyngioma accounts for around 3% of all primary tumours of the central nervous system. It is usually located in the suprasellar region, although it may also have an ectopic location. CASE REPORT: The case is presented on 29 year-old male who underwent surgery for a jaw osteoma when he was 19 years old and was subsequently diagnosed with Gardner's syndrome. He was admitted in our Hospital with right facial paresis and diplopia of one day onset. The examination showed mild right VII and VI cranial nerves paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a rounded solid and cystic lesion with well-defined contours of about 2cm in diameter filling the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent a posterior fossa craniotomy using a telovelar approach with complete removal of the tumour implanted at roof level of the fourth ventricle. The final histology of the tumour was reported as adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. CONCLUSION: Craniopharyngioma may appear in another location other than the suprasellar region. Its atypical location may be related to Gardner syndrome by still unknown pathogenic mechanisms.",0,1149
233,"A 70 year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of abdominal pain, weight loss and night sweats. On physical examination, she presented with a 5 cm diameter abdominal mass extended from epigastrium to the left flank, and at least three bilateral supraclavicular adenopathies. A disseminated interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma was diagnosed through a biopsy of the abdominal mass. After that, a CHOP regime (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) was iniciated. She died after completion of the first cycle of treatment, six months after diagnosis.",0,595
234,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus involved in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and rapid renal failure. Hospital outbreak and nosocomial transmission were reported, however, several issues remain on the viral excretion course. OBJECTIVES: Describe the kinetics and pattern of viral excretion in two infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: After the initial diagnosis, blood, urine, rectal and respiratory samples were collected regularly, aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees C. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay targeted the UpE and Orf1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome. RESULTS: In patient 1, who died of refractory ARDS and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs, as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day. Rectal swabs were negative. Patient 2 also developed multiple-organ failure, but survived, with persisting renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance at 30 mL/min) and persistent interstitial syndrome albeit weaned off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen. Tracheal aspirations were positive until the 33rd day, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. All other biological samples were negative. DISCUSSION: Lower respiratory tract excretion of MERS-CoV could be observed for more than one month. The most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine, consistent with a type-1 interferon mediated immunological response impaired in patient 1, but developed by patient 2. These results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to MERS-CoV.",1,1724
235,"Cutaneous metastases appear in 0.6% to 10.4% of malignant tumors and account for 2% of all cutaneous tumors. Metastasis to the skin may arise from progression of a known primary tumor or provide the first sign of an unsuspected one. Acral metastases are particularly unusual. Most derive from bone tumors. Clinical signs vary and the lesions generally resemble infection or inflammation, leading to diagnostic delays. When metastasis involves the fingers, the primary tumor is usually lung carcinoma. In contrast, toe involvement usually derives from a tumor in the genitourinary tract. A pathologic diagnosis in these cases is necessary and will suggest the location of the primary tumor. We report 2 cases of metastasis to the fingers. One is the first report of acral metastasis of a myoepithelial carcinoma of the breast. The other concerns acral metastasis as the first sign of lung carcinoma.",0,898
236,"Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a rare inherited disease caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene. Its recessive variant (recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa) is characterized by the absence or considerably reduced expression of type VII collagen, which leads to marked fragility of the skin and mucous membranes and subsequent blister formation, whether spontaneously or following minimal injury. There have been very few reports of this disease in pregnant women. We present 2 cases of pregnant women with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa managed in our High-Risk Pregnancy Unit at Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain. Both patients underwent full-term cesarean delivery, with no further complications for mother or child. Although recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa increases the risk of maternal complications, a patient is not advised against pregnancy. With adequate monitoring, these patients can fulfil their desire to become mothers.",0,978
237,"Bacteremia is an atypical presentation of Campylobacter jejuni infection and it is more frequent in patients with advanced inmunodepression due to HIV or other sistemic diseases. Because of the highly active antiretroviral therapy, in the last decades the number of cases had declined.

238,"Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease with unknown cause characterized by non-caseating granuloma formations. It may present with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, eye and musculoskeletal system involvement. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are important electrolyte imbalances resulting from sarcoidosis and sometimes they may cause nephrolitiasis and kidney failure. Hyponatremia, although being quite rare, has been found in some patients with sarcoidosis. Herein, we have reported a patient with neurosarcoidosis who presented with hyponatremia and responded well to corticosteroid treatment.",0,610
239,"OBJECTIVE: We report two cases of patients diagnosed of paratesticular liposarcoma and perform a literature review of this rare entity. Our aim is to clarify its clinical and therapeutic characteristics. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of two patients diagnosed of liposarcoma of the spermatic cord. RESULTS: Case 1: 65 year old male, presented a left large scrotal mass of 20 x 14 x 11 cm. He underwent radical orchiectomy. Pathology reported a well differentiated spermatic cord liposarcoma. After one year of follow-up the patient was asymptomatic and there was no evidence of local recurrence. Case 2: A 90 year old man, with past medical history of right orchiectomy for well-differentiated cord liposarcoma 11 years before, and excision of recurrence 7 years ago. On follow up he presented a new 20 x 14 x 11 cm inguinal tumor recurrence. We performed excision of the mass, which was reported by pathology as well differentiated spermatic cord liposarcoma. Ten months after surgery the patient was asymptomatic without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Liposarcoma is a very rare entity and its diagnosis is based on the pathological findings. It is therefore difficult to establish the guidelines for treatment, prognosis and differential diagnosis. As in liposarcomas in other sites, the histological type and grade of the lesion are useful for the prognosis. Radical inguinal orchiectomy and resection of the tumor with a negative microscopic margin is the recommended treatment for liposarcoma of the spermatic cord. It has not been demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, except in specific situations. The natural history of disease is slow and it has low mortality, but high recurrence rate, so a long-term monitoring is necessary.",0,1803
240,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of management and close follow-up of patients with tuberous sclerosis that associate renal angiomyolipomas. METHODS: To report a case. RESULTS: A 55 years old men with tuberous sclerosis diagnosed in childhood and later finding of bilateral giant renal masses in imaging studies, with significant compromise of renal function. The patient did not have a proper follow up and did not receive any treatment. At the moment he has end stage kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Patients that associate renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis, have specific characteristics with a higher risk of complications requiring strict follow-up and specific treatment.",0,686
241,"Combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion is uncommon in adults and even more so in young people. The main origins are vasculitis and thromboembolic disorders. The prognosis is poor due to irreversible visual loss and the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG). A 14 year-old male arrived at the clinic complaining of sudden and painless visual loss in the left eye. Best corrected visual acuity was light perception with clinical and fluoro-angiographic findings characteristic of combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion in his left eye. The findings in the systemic and laboratory studies led to a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient received treatment with steroids and oral anticoagulant. Seven days later, due to prolonged coagulation time, he presented with a vitreous haemorrhage. He was then treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in order to prevent NVG. Afterwards, vitrectomy and retinal endophotocoagulation were performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a male, paediatric with SLE and combined occlusion to be published in the literature, and is also the first case treated with antiangiogenic agents that has not developed NVG at 12 months of follow-up.",0,1278

243,"The present study was undertaken in order to try to clarify certain aspects of RS3PE syndrome, for which there is no unanimity of opinion in the current literature. An attempt will be made to clarify the best and most suitable drug for treatment, and the dosage duration. In order to do this, a literature search was performed, and a review is presented of the 108 cases collected. In 95% cases glucocorticoids were the most used, with prednisone in being used in 68.5% of cases. Although there is no unanimity criteria regarding the dosage and duration, 73.8% cases were treated with a prednisone dose from 15 to 20 mg/day (median 18.2 mg/day, SD 8.9). Two-thirds (66.1%) of cases were treated for 3 to 6 months (median 5.3 months, SD 3.8). A case is presented that serves as a common thread of these observations.",0,815
244,"Arterial neurovascular compression is hypothesised to be the main cause of primary trigeminal neuralgia. Although it is the most common cause, other pathologies, such as tumours in the cerebellopontine angle, can cause trigeminal pain. We report a case of a 44-year-old female patient with right trigeminal neuralgia without satisfactory response to medical treatment. Cerebral MRI showed no structural injuries. During microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve, endostosis of the internal aspect of the petrous bone was found to compress the trigeminal nerve. The pain disappeared completely in the early postsurgical period, after the complete drilling of the endostosis and microvascular decompression. The patient remains asymptomatic one year later. Endostosis of the petrous bone is a rare cause of trigeminal neuralgia. A proper review of preoperative studies would enable the definitive surgical approach to be optimised.",0,939

247,"Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin used in the neonatal period. It requires less monitoring than standard or unfractionated heparin, although current knowledge about its dose and therapeutic levels in neonates is scarce. In addition, there is very limited information about the management of overdose in this age group. We present the first case published in Spanish of a neonate who accidentally received a dose of enoxaparin ten times higher than the therapeutic one and an isolated dose of protamine to reverse its effect.",0,535
248,"Meconium periorchitis is uncommon. In the unborn child the peritoneum vaginal canal is open and, secondary to intestinal perforation due to any cause (intestinal atresia, volvulus, and others), meconium peritonitis occurs. The intestinal content reaches the scrotal vaginal cavity. Meconium peritonitis can heal spontaneously and without consequences. Calcified remnants of this event may remain in the peritoneal cavity and/or scrotum. In the newborn, a hydrocele and scrotal mass can be observed; the ultrasound will show a heterogeneous image with calcifications. Meconium periorchitis or meconium vaginalitis resolves spontaneously. The lack of awareness of this disease could lead to unnecessary surgery in the newborn. We present a 33 days old patient with a scrotal mass in whom surgery was performed with the pathological diagnosis of meconium periorchitis.",0,865
249,"Bronchial carcinoid tumours are an uncommon cause of recurrent pneumonia in young patients. Diagnosis is determined from imaging studies, bronchoscopy, and histological confirmation, and treatment is generally surgical. Two cases are reviewed in order to examine the value of (111)In-DTPA-Phe-octreotide ((111)In-pentetreotide) scintigraphy in the pre-surgical evaluation of these patients. After a suspicious area was observed in other tests (standard X-ray, CT), a neuroendocrine tumour was diagnosed using this technique and the presence of regional or distant disease was ruled out. Comparison with the less valuable (18)F-FDG PET (carried out in one of the cases) highlights the usefulness of SPECT-CT, which performs notably better in terms of the localization and characterisation of findings.",0,800

The symptoms may vary from local (e.g. abdominal tenderness or palpable mass) to systemic manifestations including abdominal pain, back pain, fever, weight loss and bowel disturbances. We presented this case as a first awareness of omental panniculitis in a child which must be kept in mind at the differential diagnosis of ileus so that unnecessary surgeries might be avoided.",0,517
251,"Mucormycosis and aspergillosis are the most frequent fungal infections caused by filamentous fungi; coinfection in the same host is rare. We present a case of a 78-year-old male patient with the debut of type 2 diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis, with swelling of the right side of the face, right facial paralysis, ptosis and a necrotic ulcer in the right palate. Facial Computed tomography showed an abscess of the right maxillary sinus. Cultured secretions revealed Aspergillus fumigatus. The pathology result of biopsies of the palate, maxillary sinus and ethmoid bone was consistent with mucormycosis. The patient was treated with voriconazole, amphotericin B deoxycholate, and surgical debridement of the maxillary sinus. The patient died despite the treatment. The coinfection of Rhinocerebral mucormycosis and aspergillosis should be suspected in immunosuppressed patients in order to establish early management that can permit an improved prognosis of the disease.",0,973
252,"INTRODUCTION: Pure acute subdural haematomas caused by aneurysmal rupture are a highly infrequent event, with only 51 cases published in the literature to date, with only six cases due to the rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysm. AIM: To describe a case of an acute subdural haematoma not associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage due to ruptured of an anterior communicating cerebral artery aneurysm. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old woman without a traumatic history, who is found at home with a level of consciousness of 4 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale and a bilateral arreactive mydriasis, which are reversed with medical measures. Cranial CT shows an acute bi-hemispherical convexity and interhemispheric subdural haematoma with no evidence of associated subarachnoid haemorrhage. The angio-CT reveals an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. We proceed to urgent embolization of the aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where intracranial pressure is monitored and controlled initially with medical treatment. Patient outcome was unfavorable, confirming in the control CT scan coincident with an increase of uncontrolled medically intracranial hypertension, established ischemic infarctions areas, which made any surgical treatment non-viable. CONCLUSION: In the case of an acute subdural haematoma without subarachnoid haemorrhage nor traumatic brain injury or its external stigmas, we must consider the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm as a possible cause. Likewise, the initial management of the acute subdural haematoma in patients with poor neurological condition should be priority and surgical.",0,1642
253,"Congenital hyperinsulinism (CH) is the most frequent cause of persistent hypoglycemia in the newborn and it is characterized by an inappropriately elevated insulin level in presence of hypoglycemia. Initial management is medical treatment, but if it fails, partial pancreatectomy is the surgical procedure of choice. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a newborn with CH to aware on this condition and update its multidisciplinary management. CASE REPORT: The case of a full term newborn with severe symptomatic hypoglycemia unresponsive to medical treatment is reported . Ultrasonography and abdominal MRI were normal, Gallium 68 PET/CT showed uptake in the body of the pancreas. Laparoscopic corporocaudal pancreatectomy was performed. The patient resolved hypoglycemia and was discharged without incidents. Genetic study was consistent with focal CH, confirmed later by biopsy.

254,"INTRODUCTION: Description of appearance of ecchymosis on an arm, simultaneously with a classical Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis, the proposal of alternative utilities of measuring blood pressure, and the study of side effects to that measure. PATIENT: Case 80-year-old male came to ER with dyspnea, heart failure, predialysis renal failure with hyperkalemia and hemodynamic instability. During his stay he developed a skin lesion that looks like palpable purpura, from the lower limit of the blood pressure cuff to the distal area of the hand that not disappeared with vitropression, and pruritus. During admission the arm injury was extended to all members, both upper and lower. RESULTS: The study concluded with diagnosis of Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis given the presence of eosinophils, that which suggested probable drug etiology to an antibiotic that had been taken since seven days prior to admission to ER. DISCUSION: The need for serial monitoring of blood pressure, and the duration of such monitoring in unstable patients considering the side effects of those techniques was questioned. In addition, the study of other utilities of measuring blood pressure.",0,1165

The clinical case of a man undergoing a scheduled hepatectomy was observerd, who presented a large asymptomatic subcapsular collection suggestive of bilioma, with progressive increase in size, spontaneously presenting a decrease until its resolution by fistulization to the hepatic angle of the colon confirmed by Radiological findings. The spontaneously formation of biliary fistulas to the colon is due to the extrinsic pressure of the collection on the intestinal wall with necrosis of the contact zone, being its presentation and radiological documentation exceptional.",0,862
258,"CLINICAL CASE: A 53-year old male presented with visual impairment in right eye after irradiation of right maxillary sinus carcinoma. Funduscopy shows radiation retinopathy: haemorrhages, exudates, macular oedema, and peripheral retinal ischaemia. A poor outcome was achieved despite laser treatment and intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, resulting in evisceration of the affected eye. DISCUSSION: Radiation retinopathy must be considered in any loss of vision after head and neck irradiation. Ophthalmological long-term follow-up of these patients is essential for an early diagnosis.",0,590
259,"BACKGROUND: The first reported case of intestinal perforation secondary to metastatic lung carcinoma was reported in 1957. Intestinal metastases are present in up to 1.8% of the cases, with small bowel obstruction as the most common clinical presentation. CLINICAL CASE: An 89 year-old male, who was diagnosed with a high-grade pulmonary mucoepidermoid tumour 2 months previously. The patient was admitted to the hospital for 3 days due to diffuse colic abdominal pain of moderate to severe intensity, accompanied by nausea and gastric vomiting, as well as 2 episodes of bloody bowel movements. On physical examination, the patient was noted to have tachycardia and tachypnoea, as well as clinical signs of acute abdomen. He had white cells of 24,900 per mm(3), and 87% neutrophils. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, which showed a bowel perforation associated with a tumour mass 15cm beyond the angle of Treitz. Bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed. The histopathological analysis reported the diagnosis of a high-grade mucoepidermoid tumour with small bowel and mesentery with disease-free surgical margins. Unfortunately the patient had a fatal outcome secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The cases of metastases to small bowel are extremely rare, and to our knowledge this is first case reported in Mexico. The patient described went to the emergency room with gastrointestinal bleed and intestinal perforation that required urgent surgical intervention with small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. Unfortunately the patient died secondary to hospital acquired pneumonia.",0,1622
260,"(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging is useful in patients with fever of unknown origin and can detect giant cell arteritis in extracranial large arteries. However, it is usually assumed that temporal arteries cannot be visualized with a PET/CT scanner due to their small diameter. Three patients with clinical symptoms of temporal arteritis were examined using a standard whole body PET/CT protocol (skull base - mid thighs) followed by a head PET/CT scan using the brain protocol. High (18)F-FDG uptake in the aorta and some arterial branches were detected in all 3 patients with the whole body protocol. Using the brain protocol, head imaging led to detection of high (18)F-FDG uptake in temporal arteries as well as in their branches (3 patients), in occipital arteries (2 patients) and also in vertebral arteries (3 patients).",0,819
261,"BACKGROUND: Diverticular disease, and the diverticulitis, the main complication of it, are widely studied diseases with multiple chronic cases reported in the literature, but there are no atypical presentations with extra-abdominal symptoms coupled with seemingly unrelated entities, such as necrotising fasciitis. CLINICAL CASE: Female 52 years old, was admitted to the emergency department with back pain of 22 days duration. History of importance: Chronic use of benzodiazepines intramuscularly. Physical examination revealed the presence of a gluteal abscess in right pelvic limb with discoloration, as well as peri-lesional cellulitis and crepitus that stretches across the back of the limb. Fasciotomy was performed with debridement of necrotic tissue. Progression was torpid with crackling in abdomen. Computed tomography showed free air in the cavity, and on being surgically explored was found to be complicated diverticular disease. DISCUSSION: It is unusual for complicated diverticular disease to present with symptoms extra-peritoneal (< 2%) and even more so that a diverticulitis is due to necrotising fasciitis (< 1%). The absence of peritoneal manifestations delayed the timely diagnosis, which was evident with the crackling of the abdomen and abdominal computed tomography scan showing the parietal gaseous process. CONCLUSION: All necrotising fasciitis needs an abdominal computed tomography scan to look for abdominal diseases (in this case diverticulitis), as their overlapping presentation delays the diagnosis and consequently the treatment, making a fatal outcome inevitable.",0,1599
262,"Septicemia is the main cause of neonatal mortality. The early-onset neonatal sepsis is usually related to maternal factor risks including recto-vaginal colonization. In the late-onset neonatal septicemia it is more difficult to establish the etiology because the majority of the cases are nosocomial or community related. The Streptococcus agalactiae (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) is the most frequent germ associated with neonatal sepsis in developed countries. The late-onset form usually occurs with septic symptoms and meningitis and, in a few cases, with osteoarticular, skin and soft tissue infection. Adenitis-cellulitis syndrome is rarely seen, and its main cause is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae. We report two cases of group B Streptococcus late-onset neonatal septicemia, both of them with adenitis-cellulitis syndrome. Patients recovered uneventfully after an adequate antibiotic therapy.",0,931

IPPFE is characterized by pleural and subpleural parenchymal fibrosis causing volume loss predominantly in the upper lung lobes. Age of onset is variable, IPPFE mainly occurs in third and fourth decades. We present a 16 year old patient with a 2-year history of exertional dyspnea, nonproductive cough and weight loss. On physical examination, auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds on the upper lobes. Chest radiograph showed apical pleural thickening and volume loss. Computerized tomographic scan (CT) of chest revealed ground glass densities and tubular bronchiectasis predominantly in upper lobes bilaterally, with interlobular septal thickening of the pleura and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed and histological evaluation showed subpleural fibrosis and elastic staining demonstrated fragmented elastic fiber deposition in the subpleural area and adjacent pulmonary parenchyma suggesting IPPFE. To our knowledge this is the first case in childhood. Therefore, pediatricians should be aware of this disease for the diagnosis and appropriate management.",0,1335

Most of them appear as asymptomatic lesions in middle-aged women but they can manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal or pelvic pain, constipation or diarrhoea, genitourinary symptoms, etc. Due to their anatomical position and variable presentation these lesions are often misdiagnosed. Complications include infection and malignant transformation, which is the reason why surgical treatment is always indicated. We report a case of a woman with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain that lasted for many years and increased progressively, conditioning her daily life activities. Image studies showed a non-complicated retrorectal cystic hamartoma. Complete surgical excision was achieved and the patient remains asymptomatic nowadays. Key words. Retrorectal cystic hamartoma.

Fungal sepsis and endocarditis may be an important morbidity in preterm infants; we review the recent literature about the risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of fungal sepsis in these high risk infants.",0,704
267,"BACKGROUND: A caecal appendix within an inguinal hernia, with or without appendicitis, is defined as Amyand's hernia. In 1% of inguinal hernias an appendix without inflammation can be found, however, the prevalence of appendicitis in a hernia sac is only 0.08-0.13%. CLINICAL CASE: Male of 43 years old, began two days before admission with pain in the right inguinal region. He was scheduled for surgery due to a complication of a right inguinal hernia. The surgical findings were Amyand's hernia, necrotic spermatic cord, and perforated appendix. Surgical repair was performed with a favourable outcome, and he was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. DISCUSSION: Most of Amyand's hernia exhibit characteristics of incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia. Even acute appendicitis or perforated appendix within the hernia sac does not reflect specific symptoms or signs, therefore, a preoperative clinical diagnosis of Amyand's hernia is difficult to achieve. In our case, the patient had perforated appendicitis, developing necrosis of the spermatic cord. Orchiectomy, appendectomy, and inguinal hernia repair was performed without placing mesh. Due to the controversy on the use of mesh in contaminated abdominal wall defects, it was not indicated here, due to the high risk of wound infection and appendicular fistula. CONCLUSION: An extremely rare condition is presented, with a surgical choice that led to a favourable outcome.",0,1445

However, vasculitides of large vessels such as Takayasu's and giant cell (temporal) arteritis do not. Exceptionally ANCA(+) small vessel vasculitides are associated with large vessel vasculitis. It may be a coincidence or both vasculitides have a common pathogenesis. We report a 30 years old woman on hemodialysis due to a chronic glomerulonephritis ANCA(+) diagnosed nine years ago. Eight years later, she presented with an aortitis with severe stenosis of distal aorta and vasculitis of left subclavian artery. She was treated with adrenal steroids and cyclophosphamide.

270,"Teratoma is a common form of germ cell tumors composed of multiple tissues foreign to the site in which arise with a histological representation of all three germ cell layers. Intracranial teratomas are very rare. In this study, we report three cases of intracranial teratomas with an interesting clinical course, neuroradiology, and outcome. In addition, we review the literature and convey important messages to the neuroscience community regarding issues related to the management of these rare tumors. The present cases are interesting examples of intracranial teratoma in terms of location of the tumor and neuroimaging findings. Delay in surgical intervention may complicate the course of the disease with progressive enlargement of tumors and development of complication including hydrocephalus. Using endoscopic surgical techniques may emerge as the preferred intervention option as compared to other traditional methods.

273,"Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial solid tumor in childhood, representing 5.6% according to the ""Registro Oncopediatrico Hospitalario Argentino"". For its diagnosis, several complementary methods (radiological, biological and biochemical) are required, and Multi-parametric Flow Cytometry (MFC) arises as a potential diagnostic method, despite not having been so far extensively explored. MFC is a method that allows to obtain several information about size, internal complexity and antigenic expression by the use of a laser and fluorescent monoclonal antibodies. There are an increasing number of reports in the literature, which reveal the importance of using MFC for diagnosis and monitoring of solid tumors. The aim in this presentation is to highlight the fundamental role that MFC had in the case of a patient affected by neuroblastoma, in which an early diagnosis using this methodology allowed prompt administration of adequate treatment.",0,959

CLINICAL CASE: 24 year old male patient carrying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, who began with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen and fever 72 hours before arriving in the emergency room. A computed tomography was performed that showed free fluid in the cavity, and gastric wall thickening. The patient underwent a laparotomy, finding absence of the anterior wall of the stomach, sealed with the left lobe of the liver, colon and omentum. Total gastrectomy, with oesophagosty and jejunostomy tube, was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric perforation secondary to a MALT lymphoma is rare, with high mortality. There is limited information reported of this complication and should be highly suspected in order to provide appropriate treatment for a complication of this type.",0,1139
275,"Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also known as celiac artery compression syndrome, is a rare and unusual clinical disorder. Its symptoms are non-specific, which complicates its diagnosis, and a multidisciplinary approach is required to treat the disorder. The ligament is circumferentially cleared by laparoscopy. Selective angiography and endovascular techniques may be used after laparoscopy. Vital organs and important vascular structures can be injured during the surgery. The combination of different procedures, as well as the high risk of damage, make this process a significant challenge for the anaesthetist. During corrective surgery for median arcuate ligament syndrome, general anaesthesia must be adapted to the various haemodynamic and ventilatory requirements, and strict control of pain established, as oral tolerance is a key factor in the post-operative recovery of these patients.",0,900
276,"Emphysematous cystitis is found in diabetic patients and in individuals with urinary stasis and immunosuppression. We report a 58-year-old male with hypertension, type 2 Diabetes on insulin treatment and central nervous system vasculitis on immunosuppressive therapy. He was admitted with weight loss and gait instability. A PET-CT showed a circumscribed image of air in the bladder contour without involving the upper urinary tract, suggesting emphysematous cystitis. Re-interrogated, the patient referred pneumaturia, dysuria and febrile sensation one week before admission. Urine culture showed Enterobacter aerogenes. He was treated with a urinary catheter, metabolic control and parenteral antimicrobials. The patient was discharged without symptoms 21 days after admission, with the bladder catheter.",0,806
277,"Adrenal myelolipoma is a rare, benign, non-functioning tumor. It is composed by fat and hematopoietic tissues. We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with diagnosis of a 14 cm diameter non-functioning right adrenal incidentaloma, with imaging features suggestive of myelolipoma. Based on the benign nature of the tumor, laparoscopic resection was performed. Histopathology showed a myelolipoma, weighting 444 grams. The patient evolved with an uneventful postoperative period. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for a giant myelolipoma was feasible and successful.",0,560
278,"Portosystemic shunts are rare vascularization disorders, and an uncommon cause of confusional states. We report an 87-year-old male with a previously normal cognitive status who was repeatedly admitted for sudden symptoms of disorientation and functional limitation. The patient had high ammonium levels which lead to the suspicion of the presence a portosystemic shunt, even in the absence of pre-existing liver disease. A contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed the presence an abnormal communication of the right portal vein with the suprahepatic veins. The communication was embolized and the confusional states of the patient subsided.",0,663
279,"If Septic shock (SS) evolves to refractory SS, mortality could reach 90%, despite giving an optimal treatment. Nowadays, extracorporeal devices which adsorb inflammatory cytokines are available, reducing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. These devices can be used with continuous renal replacement therapy or conventional hemodialysis. We report two diabetic females aged 50 and 58 years, who underwent a total colectomy and amputation of diabetic foot and who developed a SS with high requirements of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine and adrenaline) to maintain a mean arterial pressure about 60 mmHg. Both were subjected to hemodialysis, connected to a cytokine hemadsorption device. The most important finding was the progressive reduction of vasopressor doses, effect that was observed nine hours after the beginning of the hemadsorption and lasted until its removal at 26 hours. Both patients survived.",0,918

282,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) display similar clinical and hematological characteristics. The objective of the present study was to determine the mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R in these diseases. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The mutational status of SETBP1 and CSF3R was studied in 7 patients with aCML (n = 3), CNL (n = 1) and unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN-u) (n = 3). Additionally, mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, and RUNX1 were also analyzed. RESULTS: SETBP1 mutations (G870S and G872R) were detected in 2 patients with MPN-u, and one of them also presented mutations in SRSF2 (P95H) and ASXL1 (E635fs). The CNL case showed mutations in CSFR3 (T618I), SETBP1 (G870S) and SRSF2 (P95H). No patient classified as aCML had mutations in SETBP1 or CSF3R. One of the patients with mutations evolved to acute myeloid leukemia, while the other 2 had disease progression without transformation to overt leukemia. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of the molecular alterations involved in these rare diseases is useful in the diagnosis and may have an impact on both prognosis and therapy.",0,1179
283,"Spain is one of the countries where most solid organ transplants are performed each year, in the year 2014 a 2.7% of them were given in childhood. Given the complexity and severity of this disease it is necessary to establish a care plan that covers both pre-transplant and post-transplant, with close cooperation between different levels of care, to approach the several problems that can appear and assure continuum of care. In the following example, a Gambian teen with risk of social exclusion fostered a collaboration between the primary care nurse and transplant nurse that was the key to continuum care. Multiple strategies were used in the care plan to ensure better adherence and compliance of the treatment. However, the knowledge of the culture of origin must be deepened to establish more individualized care plans and thus improve results. The care plan included problems according to the NANDA, NOC, NIC taxonomy.",0,927
284,"INTRODUCTION: The term 'painful tic convulsive' is used to describe the syndrome involving concomitant hemifacial spasm and ipsilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Vascular compression of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves is the most common cause, involving the entry and exit zone of rootlets coming from the brainstem; nevertheless, different etiologies of this syndrome has been previously reported. Treatment for this disease is based on surgical microvascular decompression of the nerve rootlets, but still a topic of debate. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old woman with history of 14 years presenting left trigeminal neuralgia, associated with ipsilateral hemifacial spasm for more than ten years. Medical treatment was installed without adequate symptom control. Patient was subjected to surgical treatment via a microasterional approach, with dissection of arachnoid fibrous tissue surrounding fifth and seventh nerves during the first surgery. A second surgery was performed with insertion of a teflon fragment aside of each exit nerve root (V and VII-VIII complex). Symptoms resolved immediately after the surgery and has persisted during the 1-year follow-up. Painful tic convulsive etiology could be multifactorial. CONCLUSION: This report is the first clinical case describing basal arachnoiditis as a primary cause of painful tic convulsive.",0,1345
285,"We report the case of a 26-year-old man who died suddenly 9 days after an episode of flu. Microscopic examination of the left anterior descending coronary artery showed an eccentric fibroatheromatic plaque complicated by thrombosis, endothelial erosion and extensive T-cell and macrophage infiltration. Frozen sections of the thrombotic coronary segment, analysed for different infective agents by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, showed positive amplification for an enteroviral genome. Enteroviral infection may play an important role in coronary plaque instability and may precipitate thrombotic occlusion.",1,644
286,"Left ventricular rupture is an infrequent but potentially fatal complication of mitral valve replacement. In spite of the fact that several methods of repair have previously been described, the mortality rate remains nearly 85%. The use of the intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation may increase the possibilities of success in the repair of this dreaded complication. We present here three cases of left ventricular rupture associated to mitral valve prosthesis implantation successfully treated with the aid of intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation.",0,560
287,"A case is presented of a hemarthrosis associated with osteochondritis dissecans in a young man who arrived in the Emergency unit due to tender and swelling of his right knee one hour after a slightly rotational gesture of the lower limb. Many years before the patient suffered a sports injury in the same knee, but it was never assessed. Radiography studies showed bone fragments inside the synovial capsule, and the joint aspiration was compatible with hemarthrosis. A review of the available information of this uncommon condition is also presented.",0,551
288,"BACKGROUND: The actinomyces is germ commonly found in the normal flora of the oral cavity and gastro-intestinal and uro-genital tracts. Involvement in other locations is a very uncommon event. OBJECTIVES: To describe a patient with an actinomicotyc brain abscess CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a patient who suffered a seizure and decreased level of consciousness. Imaging tests revealed the presence of lesions both in the lung and in the brain. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the diagnosis of actinomicotyc abscess was obtained. CONCLUSION: We describe the differential characteristics of this type of infection, discussing the diagnostic process and management in detail.",0,688
289,"DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) is an adverse life-threatening drug reaction characterized by a polymorphous rash associated with fever, lymphadenopathy and multiorgan involvement with eosinophilia. We present the case of an immunocompetent man with DRESS syndrome secondary to carbamazepine, that developed concomitantly meningoencephalitis caused by human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), and a review of literature. The pathogenic role of HHV-6 in DRESS syndrome remains controversial. Given the diagnostic and possibly prognostic significance of HHV-6, the screening seems to be a good measure to use in the clinical management of these patients.",0,680
290,"We report the case of a 56-year-old female patient, with a three-day history of hematemesis, melena, abdominal wall hematoma and epistaxis associated with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed and she was treated with dexamethasone for four days. The patient developed acute respiratory failure with signs of systemic inflammatory response. Blood and pleural fluid cultures grew Pasteurella canis. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of P. canis empyema associated with hemorrhagic septicemia without epidemiological background and the third case of septicemia caused by P. canis reported in the literature.",0,654
291,"Pachyonychia congenita is a group of autosomal dominant inheritance pattern disorders characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy There are two main clinical subtypes: type 1 and 2. Pachyonychia congenita type 2 is readily differentiated from type 1 by multiple steatocysts and/or presence of natal teeth and can be confirmed by mutations of KRT6B and KRT17.

It is a rare clinical entity that mainly affects young Asian women, although it found worldwide. It is a benign and self-limiting condition; however, its importance lies in its differential diagnosis with other clinical entities such as lymphoma or histiocytoma. We present a case of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, with special emphasis on its clinicopathological significance and its evolution during outbreaks. Antimalarial therapy causes remission and we discuss the use of hydroxychloroquine for reoccurring cases.",0,709

METHODS: Description of clinical cases, medical and surgical management and pathologic results of surgical specimens. RESULTS: We report two cases of patients with extravesical mitomycin leakage after postoperative instillation. No bladder perforation was evident during tumor surgery. In both cases radical cystectomy was required. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative mitomycin instillation may have undesirable consequences. The possible problems derived from its administration must be known, and each case must be individualized before administering this chemotherapy.",0,686

There are no validated diagnostic criteria in children. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not always sufficient, and the use of corticosteroids, disease-modifying agents, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors or bisphosphonates may be necessary. We present the case of a child with polyarticular involvement, osteoarthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with severe inflammatory disorders and acne conglobata, with an excellent response to intravenous pamidronate.",0,745
295,"Nicolau syndrome, also known as embolia cutis medicamentosa or livedo-like dermatitis, is a sudden tissue necrosis, a rare complication of intramuscular injection of some drugs. We report a case of a 6-month-old girl who received intramuscularly the third dose of hexavalent vaccine (DTaP- HVB-IPV/HIb), and immediately presented a livedoid lesion around the injection site, progressing to necrosis. We reinforce the importance of early diagnosis to perform a suitable treatment and clinical follow-up to avoid ischemic secondary complications.",0,544
296,"Difficult airway management remains one of the key points in our specialty, as the difficulty or impossibility of tracheal intubation is the main cause of morbidity/mortality attributable to anaesthesia. Rett syndrome is a severe and incapacitating neurological disease. We present the case of a 21-year-old girl affected by this syndrome, with significant psychomotor retardation and difficult airway predictors, who was scheduled to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia. We decided on one attempt of Clarus Video System((R)) fiberoptic intubation as primary intervention. Intubation was successfully performed with the help of this optical stylet. The use of optical stylets is gaining prominence and finding a place in the latest algorithms of difficult airway management. We highlight the growing role these devices play in managing difficult airway, therefore we review the current situation of videolaryngoscopes in the management of the predicted difficult airway.",0,996
297,"Bone involvement of syphilis can be observed in tertiary and congenital syphilis. It is infrequent during the secondary stage. The skull is the most affected bone in secondary syphilis, and its most frequent form of presentation is proliferative osteitis. If the skull is affected, headache is usual and can be as intense as in meningitis. Osteolyitic lesions may be seen in complimentary imaging studies, with a moth eaten aspect. These lesions raise concern over a number of differential diagnoses, among which are infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. The definitive diagnosis is made by bone biopsy of the compromised bone. Molecular techniques in the affected tissues increases diagnostic performance. There is no standardized treatment protocol for syphilis since there are no guidelines available. We report a case of a 19 year old female, presenting with a unique osteolytic lesion in the skull due to secondary syphilis.",0,941
298,"Hypothenar hammer syndrome is an uncommon injury of the ulnar artery in its passage through Guyon's canal, and has been associated with repetitive trauma. Its diagnosis requires of a high level of suspicion and a careful clinical interview. The appropriate treatment is not well defined in the literature, ranging widely from medical treatment to reconstructive surgery. A clinical case is presented of a 52 year-old healthy male, who presented with numbness of his fourth and fifth fingers after a trauma at the hypothenar eminence. The Allen test highlighted an absence of vascularisation from the ulnar artery, thus suspecting an ulnar artery thrombosis, which was later confirmed by angio-MRI. The thrombosed segment was resected and a by-pass with a forearm vein was performed to reconstruct the distal arterial flow, presenting with a good functional outcome at 6months follow-up.",0,886
299,"Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare lung tumor of childhood that can occur with cystic or solid lesions, as a radiological finding with or without respiratory symptoms. We report the case of a 2 year old toddler in his first pulmonary obstructive episode with suspected toracic malformation of the left upper lobe in his chest x-ray and tomography. Surgery was performed showing cystic malformation of the left upper lobe. We received the pathology report with diagnosis of type I pleuropulmonary blastoma. He began follow-up with Oncology initiating treatment with cyclophosphamide and vincristine, well tolerated. Currently, there is controversy about the management of congenital lung cysts, tilting the balance towards the surgical procedure because of serious difficulties in differentiating benign pulmonary cysts from pleuropulmonary blastoma without histopathologic review.",0,880
300,"OBJETIVE: Primary undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) of the testicular tunics is rare, and synchronism with other malignancies of the urinary tract is uncommon, and may complicate the staging and therapeutic approach. We report the case of a patient diagnosed with primary paratesticular UPS with synchronous Renal Carcinoma. METHODS: Patient presenting with intrascrotal tumor who underwent left radical orchiectomy. In staging work up studies a second urologic neoplasia was found in the kidney. Histological diagnosis using immunohistochemical techniques for adequate characterization was performed. Adjuvant treatment options were evaluated. We review the literature and discuss the case. RESULTS: The UPS diagnosis was performed with immunohistochemistry. Paratesticular origin from testicular tunics was evident in the macroscopic evaluation. After finding the synchronic ipsilateral renal tumor, he underwent conventional left radical nephrectomy, ipsilateral adrenalectomy, excision of remnant left cord and para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy. He received chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy. Currently, after twelve months of follow-up there is no evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The UPS is a heterogeneous group with an exclusion immunohistochemical diagnosis. Its management requires a multidisciplinary approach; the initial surgical treatment is accepted for the paratesticular mass with high section radical orchiectomy. Although there is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of adjunctive lymphadenectomy, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.",0,1572
301,"Idiopathic chondrolysis of the hip is a very rare disease occurring during adolescence. Pain and limp are the most common symptoms and are a consequence of an accelerated loss of the articular cartilage with a lower range of move-ment producing rigidity in the last instance. The natural history is unpredictable and varies between complete and spon-taneous recovery and the ankylosis. The current recommended treatment is conservative, restricting the surgical option for residual stiffness. A clinical case of an eleven year old patient is presented. He consulted for a 2 year, torpid course of left groin pain with limp and rigidity. He received treatment with rest, discharge, analgesics and rehabilitation without any improvement initially. He was treated conservatively with NSAIDS, extremity discharge periods, soft traction in the hospital and at home and rehabilitation, recovering mobility and normal gait 6 years after the beginning of the symptoms. Twelve years after the onset of the symptoms the patient leads a normal life without symptoms and has a symmetric range of motion of both hips.",0,1104

303,"CLINICAL CASE: A case of surgical removal of a subfoveal perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) bubble that remained trapped inside the subretinal space. PFCL bubble extraction was performed by performing a therapeutic and vacuum PFCL bubble macular retinal detachment. DISCUSSION: The elapsed time before subfoveal PFCL extraction seems to influence the visual result. There are other factors which could influence the final visual acuity significantly, nevertheless it is possible to achieve useful vision, as long as the fovea is not damaged and iatrogenic injuries are avoided during PFCL bubble extraction.",0,602
304,"Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) agents have dramatically changed the management of Crohns Disease (CD). However, a significant number of these patients do not respond at all or cease to respond to antibodies against TNF. In this clinical situation, the options include intensification of anti-TNF therapy by either increasing the dose or by shortening the administration interval, the use of a second anti-TNF or medications with a different mechanism of action. Among the later, Natalizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins, is safe and effective in inducing and maintaining remission in active CD patients refractory to anti-TNF. In spite of this, Natalizumab use has been limited because of an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalophaty which results from reactivation of the John Cunningham (JC) virus. However, the presence of antibodies against JC virus in serum can be used to reduce the risk for this complication. We report three patients with Crohns disease refractory to treatment with infliximab, who responded successfully to the use of Natalizumab.",0,1138
305,"Blinatumomab is a first class bispecific T-cell engager that has been shown to achieve negative minimal residual disease in patients with relapsed or refractory pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia after conventional chemotherapy. Nevertheless, there is little evidence about its role as an off label enhancer of cytological remission prior to stem cell transplantation (SCT). We describe the case of a patient with an excellent performance status who was allowed to undergo alogenic SCT after a single blinatumomab cycle, as well as the management of adverse events and the observed results.",0,590
306,"CASE REPORT: A 22-year- old woman with an acute hydrops and Descemet membrane detachment was managed by intracameral air injection combined with multiple corneal stromal venting incisions for the drainage of intrastromal fluid. No intraoperative complications were encountered, and the intrastromal fluid was resolved over 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: Acute corneal hydrops is a significant complication of keratoconus. If not treated, resolution usually occurs over a period of 2-4 months. The persistent oedema can cause complications, such as corneal neovascularisation, infection and corneal perforation.",0,600
307,"CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old woman without any known systemic disorder presented with a complaint of painful and rapidly increasing proptosis in her right eye. Based on the clinical, radiological, analytical and ophthalmological assessments, the diagnosis made was Burkitt's lymphoma in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. CONCLUSION: Proptosis can be an unusual way of presenting with Burkitt's lymphoma associated with acquired immunodeficiency. This differential diagnosis is important because confirmation leads to a change in the vital prognosis of the patient.",0,570
308,"Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires early recognition, hospitalization and adequate treatment. Currently, the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis (UC) is recommended in the case of severe disease refractory to corticosteroids, once that superimposed bacterial or viral infections (such as cytomegalovirus or Clostridium difficile) have been excluded. However, conventional weight-based regimens of infliximab might be insufficient for patients with ASUC. Accelerated infliximab induction regimen may increase its serum concentration levels and efficacy by reducing early colectomy rates in these patients. We report a 34 year old female presenting with an ASUC. She was initially treated with hydrocortisone 300 mg/day and mesalazine enemas 4 g/day with an unfavorable clinical response. At the fifth day of therapy, an accelerated induction therapy with infliximab was started in doses of 10 mg/kg at weeks 0, 1 and 4. After the second dose, there was a favorable response with reduction of abdominal pain, stool frequency and hematochezia. She was discharged with prednisone and azathioprine. After a year of starting infliximab, the patient remains in clinical remission.",0,1239
309,"CASE REPORT: After inadvertent intravitreal injection of Celestone(R) (betamethasone sodium phosphate and acetate, benzalkonium chloride) in a patient, the macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images showed hyper-reflectivity, thinning, and irregular spikes in the inner retinal layers. These early findings could explain the toxic secondary anatomical changes due to the drug itself and/or to its excipients. Late and permanent SD-OCT findings included changes in the ellipsoid zone and cystic-like spaces. DISCUSSION: In this case, SD-OCT images can help to better understand the pathophysiology of the retinal damage and to diagnose the associated complications, providing information with prognostic value.",0,735
310,"Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth is a lichenoid dermatosis of unknown etiology. It mostly affects children and adolescents and has well-defined clinical and histological characteristics that permit a diagnosis. We present 2 new cases of annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth with classical clinical features in 2 girls, aged 2 and 4 years. The histologic findings, however, differed from those reported in the literature in that the lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate was located primarily at the top of the dermal papillae and not at the tips of the rete ridges. In both cases, the lesions regressed spontaneously without treatment.",0,637
311,"Although viruses that belong to the coronavirus family are known since the 1930s, they only gained public health attention when they were discovered to be the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China in 2002-2003. On 22 September 2012, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia announced the detection of what was described as a rare pattern of coronavirus respiratory infection in three individuals, two Saudi citizens and one person from the Gulf Region. Neither Saudi citizen survived the infection. Molecular analysis of the isolates showed that the virus belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus. It is not known if the new isolates are circulating in the population or has recently diverged. The emergence of these novel isolates that resulted in fatal human infection ascertains that health authorities all over the world must be vigilant for the possibility of new global pandemics due to novel viral infection.",1,960
312,"CASE REPORT: The case is reported of a 61 year-old woman with Purtscher-like retinopathy associated with acute renal failure. Ophthalmic examination, fluorescein-angiography, and optical coherence tomography were consistent with Purtscher-like retinopathy. Ophthalmic symptoms and signs preceded renal failure. Pancreatitis and other systemic diseases were ruled out. The patient developed a neovascular glaucoma. DISCUSSION: Purtscher-like retinopathy rarely precedes the associated systemic illness. Early diagnosis based on ophthalmic symptoms may help in the recognition and treatment of the disease, and prevent later complications.",0,637
313,"The bone liposclerosing myxofibrous tumor (LSMFT) was initially described by Ragsdale in 1986 as a polymorphic fibroosseous bone lesion with a mix of histologic elements that include lipoma, fibroxanthoma, myxoma, myxofibroma, fat necrosis, ischemic ossification, areas of fibrous dysplasia, and infrequent presence of cartilage or cystic changes. The most frequently reported location is the intertrochanteric area of the femur. Radiologically it is a lytic, geographic lesion, with well-defined margins and usually sclerotic. In some cases findings include mineralization inside the lesion or a certain degree of expansion to the contour. The close relationship between LSMFT and fibrous dysplasia has been described based on the histologic characteristics and the presence of the Gsalpha mutation. Another hypothesis of the etiology of the lesion is the reaction of fibrous dysplasia to stress.",0,897
314,"Bronchial obstruction is infrequent in the child. The main cause is malacia or benign stenosis. Management alternatives range from conservative treatment to complex surgical and/or endoscopic techniques. Placement of a stent can play a key role in situations where there is no other therapeutic option. However, the ideal stent is not yet available. In the last few years, progress has been made in the development and characterization of novel biodegradable materials in order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional stents made of silicone or metal. We present our experience with a new type of biodegradable airway stent in the treatment of severe bronchomalacia in a 2-year-old child; we evaluate safety and clinical effectiveness. We describe the indications and potential complications of pediatric endoprosthesis in the airway.",0,835
315,"CLINICAL CASE: The case is reported of a 32 year-old man with a bilateral cystoid macular oedema and serous macular detachment due to birdshot retinochoroidopathy. An intravitreal implant of 0.7 mg dexamethasone (Ozurdex(R), Allergan) was performed on both eyes, after a partial response of the macular oedema to oral and subtenon corticosteroids. Anatomical and visual improvements were observed and maintained after six months of follow up. DISCUSSION: Intravitreal dexamethasone implant may be a good therapeutic option in patients with macular oedema due to Birdshot retinochoroidopathy, and who were refractory or had intolerance to previous therapies.",0,657
316,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a systemic disease associated with the proliferation of this type of cells in tissues. Its prevalence is estimated at 1-9/100 000. Bone is the most frequently affected organ, followed by the skin, lymph nodes, haematopoietic system, pituitary gland, lungs and liver. In the majority of cases, onset occurs during childhood, with peak between one and three years of age, and poor prognosis before two years of age. The haematological forms (pancytopenia) are usually aggressive in infants. We report a case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis with neonatal onset and complex diagnosis: maintained and significant leukocytosis was the predominant data for the first two months of life, so some type of leukemia was considered. However, the most common blood disorder in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is pancytopenia rather than leukocytosis, so that the diagnosis was delayed.",0,904
317,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) secondary to interference pacemaker (PM) cable is a rare cause of progressive right heart failure (HF), which can worsen patient outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 3 clinical cases of right HF secondary to TR after PM implantation. RESULTS: In these patients the clinic is right HF, which can appear early, as in our second patient, or after years of implementation of the PM, as in the first and third patients. The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, the most accurate 3D, followed by transesophageal. The 2D transthoracic can not detect it, because it has low sensitivity for TR associated with PM. Medical treatment is always the first choice, since any other procedure carries significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Probably this is a condition that we will diagnose with increasing frequency, because there are more and more patients with devices and, at the same time, the diagnostic tools are improving.",0,1000
318,"The incidence of melanoma in children is uncommon, being particularly rare in children under 10 years-old. However, this disease is increasing by a mean of 2% per year. As in adults, the lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor, crucial to performing the selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We report 3 cases of paediatric patients of 3, 4 and 8 years-old, in which SLNB was performed for malignant melanoma. Paediatric age implies greater technical difficulty to the scintigraphy scan due to poor patient cooperation, with mild sedation required in some cases, and only being able to acquire planar images in other cases. SPECT/CT was only performed in the oldest patient. In our cases, SLNB was useful for selecting the least invasive surgery in order to reduce morbidity.",0,800
319,"The condition of immunosuppressed increases the risk of cancer in kidney transplant patients, as compared to the general population. The best survival of inmunosupressed patients in recent years has turned both neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases into the main causes of morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a renal transplanted patient who developed an unusual form of mesenchymal tumor such as the aggressive angiomyxoma, four years after the implant and requiring wide surgical resection.",0,504
320,"BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of the parathyroid gland (PC) described by De Quervain since 1909, it represents the least common neoplasm, with an incidence of 1,25/10,000,000 peoples. It has been reported approximately 1,000 cases of CP in world literature. There are two series in Mexico, one of eight patients and other with four cases. Because CP is functionally active, its early clinical behavior is similar to that of parathyroid benign neoplasms. CLINICAL CASE: A 66-year-old female with history of thighbone pain and spontaneous femoral fracture, osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone detected; the scintigraphy showed a functioning tumor located in upper mediastinum. By hemithyroidectomy in block, the tumor was resected. Histopathological study reported parathyroid carcinoma. DISCUSSION: PC is the least common neoplasia, in patients with parathyroid hormone levels greater than 1,000 pg/ml and hypercalcemia upper of 14 mg/dl this disease should be suspected.",0,1025
321,"Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an uncommon autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of 27-sterol-hydroxylase that results in an accumulation of cholestanol in the central nervous system, eyes, tendons, and blood vessels. We report a 22-year-old woman with a history of cataract surgery at the age of 14, cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis at the age of 17 and chronic diarrhea, who presented with a six months period of gait instability and frequent falls. Physical examination revealed a bilateral pyramidal and cerebellar syndrome, with no visible tendon xanthomas. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase of the signal intensity on the T2-weighted images in periventricular cerebral white matter, dentate nuclei and spinal cord. With a high suspicion of CXT, a genetic study was conducted identifying a pathogenic variant in the CYP27A1 gene. There is considerable variation in clinical characteristics and age of onset of this disease, including absence of tendon xanthomas, delaying the diagnosis. Early recognition and chronic chenodeoxycholic acid therapy can improve outcome and quality of life.",0,1138
322,"BACKGROUND: Meningeal melanomatosis is an extra-axial well-encapsulated malignant tumour with diffuse meningeal growth and dark coloration (due to high melanin contents), while meningeal melanocytoma is the focalized benign variant. Melanocytic lesions may be secondary to melanoma or be histologically benign, however, their diffuse nature makes them impossible to cure. Melanocytosis is a diffuse tumour that can form solitary extra-axial tumours, which invades the parenchyma and presents signs of malignancy with increased mitosis and Ki67, observed in 1 to 6% of immunopathological exams. Melanoma of the leptomeninges, presents signs of malignancy with anaplastic cells, which cluster in fascicles of melanin in the cytoplasm, with more than 3 atypical mitoses per field and Ki67 presenting in more than 6% of the immunopathological fields analysed. CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a patient with long-term meningeal melanomatosis, with progressive neurologic deficit and characteristic radiologic features, and another case of meningeal melanocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Benign melanocytic neoplasms of the central nervous system must be treated aggressively in the early phases with strict follow-up to avoid progression to advanced phases that do not respond to any treatment method. Unfortunately, the prognosis for malignant melanocytic lesions is very poor irrespective of the method of treatment given.",0,1414
323,"A case is presented of corneal toxicity after exposure to palytoxin. A 42 year-old man came with symptoms of pain and blurred vision in his right eye. He reported that a zoanthid coral from a saltwater aquarium had squirted into his eye. Slit-lamp examination showed a prominent central ring infiltrate of 4x6mm without epithelial defect and satellite sub-epithelial micro-infiltrates. After 2 months of topical treatment with steroids, the stromal ring infiltrate was resolved, but a stromal thinning and residual fibrosis remained. Palytoxin is a potent vasoconstrictor that damages the ionic gradient of the cells, causing cell death. It is crucial to remove the toxin and start an aggressive topical therapy as soon as possible. In addition, considering the potential ocular and systemic adverse effects that this toxin can produce, it would be advisable to inform people of its existence and regulate the distribution of this type of corals.",0,946
324,"Primary orbital cystic tumors caused by Echinococcus granulosus are rare. As this parasite is endemic in Peru, we report the case of a 10-year-old girl from a rural area of Huancavelica, who presented with progressive and irreducible axial proptosis of the right eye and loss of vision. Orbital tomographic images demonstrated a tumor mass with a cystic appearance. Serologic tests were negative. The patient underwent surgical resection, and histopathologic analysis revealed anhistic membranes, corresponding to hydatid cysts. During one year of follow-up, no evidence of local or systemic recurrence was observed. In conclusion, orbital hydatidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a cystic orbital tumor in pediatric patients, especially if the patient is from an endemic area.",0,802
325,"Tetanus is declining due to vaccination, professional labor management and appropriate wound care. Tetanus cases have been reported despite immunization. We report the case of a previously healthy 21 years old female patient that presented a mild generalized tetanus requiring admission after mild and recurrent cat scratch and bites. She had received six vaccine shots during childhood, and a booster dose five years earlier after a rabbit bite. Symptoms appeared seven weeks after the last contact, and included headache, muscle spasms and mild opisthotonus. Laboratory evaluation, including CSF analysis and microbiological investigation, as well as imaging studies were all normal. The patient received 6,000 IU of human antitoxin immunoglobulin. No autonomic manifestations or respiratory compromise were registered. Symptoms resolved rapidly and she was discharge after seven days with an order to complete a tetanus toxoid immunization schedule with three doses. CONCLUSIONS: Tetanus is possible in urban settings with a declining epidemiologic curve of disease in previously immunized patients. Severity of disease is modulated by previous vaccination.",0,1160
326,"Saint Louis encephalitis is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. In Argentina sporadic cases are registered. Symptomatic illness is unusual in children. We present a case of meningoencephalitis caused by an uncommon viral infection. The clinical signs and symptoms are unusual for pediatric patients and the bilateral thalamic compromise showed on magnetic resonance has not been described previously. An 8-year-old girl consulted due to fever, behavior disorders and ataxia. Clonus and neck stiffness were detected at physical exam. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed mononuclear leukocytosis; bilateral ischemic compromise was observed in thalamus by magnetic resonance. Saint Louis virus was confirmed by serology: serum and cerebrospinal fluid IgM were positive during the acute phase of the disease and serum IgG was positive four weeks later. Most of the signs and symptoms of the disease were resolved, however mild behavior disorders were observed as acute sequelae up to 45 days after hospital discharge.",0,1003
327,"OBJECTIVE: Describe our initial experience in the treatment of renal lithiasis with extracorporeal lithotripsy controlled by simultaneous flexible ureterorenoscopy and combined with holmium laser lithotripsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed this novel technique in a previously selected patient with left renal lithiasis, two in the superior calix, two in the medium calix and two in the inferior calix, the biggest of which was placed in medium calix and was 6mm long. We proceeded to an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and a simultaneous flexible ureterorenoscopy for better controlling the fragmentation of the lithiasis with the use of a holmium laser. In the immediate post-operative, an ultrasound was performed and, one month later, a computerized tomography (CT) was done. RESULTS: The complete fragmentation of all the lithiasis was obtained and a double-J catheter was placed. After the assessment of the absence of stone fragments by CT the catheter was removed. No intra-operative or post-operative complications were described. CONCLUSIONS: The technique described is novel, safe and reproducible. The good result obtained through this combined technique increases our interest in continuing with its application and consider it as an option for the treatment of renal lithiasis in our patients.",0,1317
328,"BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis are among the most common diagnoses that general surgeons operate on. However, it is rarely described in its synchronous form. CLINICAL CASE: A 43 year-old woman attending the clinic for right upper quadrant pain of 11 days duration. The patient refers to intermittent radiating pain in the right side, with positive Murphy, tachycardia, and fever. The laboratory results showed white cells 16,200/mm(3), glucose 345 mg/dl, abnormal liver function tests. Acute cholecystitis was reported with ultrasound. A Masson-type incision was made, noting an enlarged pyogenic gallbladder with thickened walls, sub-hepatic abscess of approximately 300 ml, greenish-yellow colour, and foetid. An anterograde subtotal cholecystectomy is performed due to difficulty in identifying elements of Calot triangle due to the inflammatory process, opening it and extracting stones. The right iliac fossa is reviewed, finding a plastron and a sub-serous retrocaecal appendix perforated in its middle third with free fecalith and an abscess in the pelvic cavity. An anterograde appendectomy was performed and the patient progressed satisfactorily, later being discharged due to improvement. DISCUSSION: In this patient, with a history of recurrent episodes of gallbladder pain and disseminated acute abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation, clinical suspicion was exacerbated cholecystitis with probable empyema of the gallbladder. Open surgery approach for this patient allowed access to both the appendix and gallbladder in order to perform a complete exploration of the abdominal cavity. CONCLUSION: The synchronous presentation of cholecystolithiasis and complicated appendicitis has not been reported in the literature.",0,1761
329,"The intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is a technique used to test and monitor nervous function. This technique has become essential in some neurosurgery interventions, since it avoids neurological injuries during surgery and reduces morbidity. The experience of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is limited in some clinical cases due to the low incidence of pregnant women undergoing a surgical procedure. A case is presented of a 29-weeks pregnant woman suffering from a cervical intraspinal tumour with intense pain, which required surgery. The collaboration of a multidisciplinary team composed of anaesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, neurophysiologists and obstetricians, the continuous monitoring of the foetus, the intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, and maintaining the neurophysiological and utero-placental variables were crucial for the proper development of the surgery. According to our experience and the limited publications in the literature, no damaging effects of this technique were detected at maternal-foetal level. On the contrary, it brings important benefits during the surgery and for the final result.",0,1156
330,"Background: Laws refer that minors do not have the capability to give informed consent for their own medical attention. However, there are special conditions in which they are allowed to decide about their health. The greater the judgement and experience limitations in minors, the less weight is given to the values and objectives they express. Also, the more adverse consequences might be, the higher the level of authority that is demanded to decide on behalf of the minor, thus granting the State the capability to guarantee the well-being of the minor. Case report: 12-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with precarious social and family background; evolution of the disease obstructed by the disregard of the treatment due to her unsanitary and extreme poverty conditions. Both of her parents died soon after the start of the treatment and she was kept under the care of her half-sister of legal age. The work and the ethical dilemma of the pediatrician and the staff of Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez are exposed within the building of support -networks with the objective of prioritizing the minor's well-being, without allowing family break-up or disintegration, thus succeeding in her recovery. Conclusions: The case was submitted to the Hospital Bioethics Committee. Inter-institutional support networks were built in order to improve dynamics of the family, thus solving the needs of the minor. Despite the misfortune of the situation, the disease was successfully overcome.",0,1537
331,"BACKGROUND: Lymphangiomas are benign tumours, considered to be congenital malformations of the lymphatic system that predominately affect children, with only a few cases reported in adults. The most common sites of these lesions are the neck (75%) and axillary region (20%), but rarely found in the spleen. OBJECTIVE: A description is presented of 3 cases of incidentally detected splenic lymphangioma, one in a child and in 2 adults, respectively, as well as a literature review. CLINICAL CASES: After a clinical and physical examination, all patients had an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan and a complete splenectomy, followed by a histopathological study on the removed spleen. Two patients were asymptomatic, and the paediatric patient referred to intermittent abdominal pain without other symptoms. The clinical and physical examinations related to the mass were negative. The final diagnosis was based on a combination of radiological and histopathological findings. Total splenectomy was undertaken in all cases without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic lymphangioma is very rare, and more so in adults. This condition is often asymptomatic and is incidentally detected by imagenology due to any other differet cause. The final diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings. Splenectomy is the treatment of choice and the prognosis is good.",0,1402
332,"Antecedentes: La neumatosis quistica intestinal es una condicion infrecuente, caracterizada por la formacion de quistes de contenido gaseoso debajo de la mucosa y la serosa intestinales. Caso clinico: Mujer de 84 anos, con antecedente de artritis reumatoide en tratamiento inmunosupresor, intervenida hace 2 anos por neumoperitoneo, con diagnostico de diverticulosis yeyunal y enfisema mesenterico, acude con cuadro de dolor abdominal difuso de 2 dias de evolucion, sin otra sintomatologia. En la radiografia de abdomen se observa neumoperitoneo con elevacion del hemidiafragma derecho y distension de asas del intestino delgado. Ante la sospecha de perforacion de viscera hueca se decide intervencion quirurgica, en la cual se diagnostica a la paciente de neumatosis quistica intestinal. Conclusion: La neumatosis quistica intestinal es de causa desconocida, aunque en un elevado porcentaje de pacientes se ha visto asociada a enfermedades pulmonares obstructivas, enfermedades del tejido conectivo, inmunosupresion o enfermedades gastrointestinales. Se localiza mas frecuentemente en el colon y el intestino delgado. Se diagnostica principalmente mediante pruebas de imagen (radiografia o tomografia computarizada). El tratamiento es conservador, realizandose intervencion quirurgica si existe sospecha de necrosis intestinal. Es dificil el diagnostico diferencial con un neumoperitoneo por perforacion de viscera hueca. Background: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is an infrequent condition, characterized by the formation of gaseous content cysts under the mucosa and intestinal serous. Clinical case: 84-year-old woman, with a history of rheumatoid arthritis under immunosuppressive treatment, operated 2 years ago by pneumoperitoneum, where she was diagnosed of jejunal diverticulosis and mesenteric emphysema, with diffuse abdominal pain of 2 days of evolution, without other symptoms. In abdominal radiography: pneumoperitoneum with elevation of right hemidiaphragm and distention of small intestine. Given the suspicion of perforation of the intestinal wall, surgical intervention was decided, in which the patient was diagnosed with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. Conclusion: Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis has an unknown etiology, although in a high percentage of patients it has been associated with obstructive pulmonary pathologies, connective tissue diseases, immunosuppression or gastrointestinal diseases. It is located more frequently in the colon and small intestine. It is diagnosed mainly through imaging tests (radiography or computed tomography). The treatment is conservative, performing surgical intervention if there is suspicion of intestinal necrosis; being difficult the differential diagnosis with a pneumoperitoneum by perforation of hollow viscera..",0,2793
333,"Penile cysts are uncommon lesions. In general, they are asymptomatic and do not interfere with sexual function. Most of them are present since birth, but usually they are only detectable in adolescence or adulthood. We report a clinical rare case of a newborns of 4 days of birth with a 3.5 cm diameter nodule on the prepuce (dorsal face), which appeared of birth. The cyst was excised by circumcision and a histopathologic study was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a mucoid cyst by ectopic urethral mucoid of penis skins. No recurrence was observed at a 6 months follow-up after of surgery.",0,607
334,"UNLABELLED: Peritonitis is a serious problem in children receiving peritoneal dialysis. Campylobacter jejuni is an unusual cause of peritonitis. A 10-year-old boy who had end stage renal failure due to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and fever. Peritoneal dialysis fluid was cloudy and microscopic examination showed abundant leukocytes. Intraperitoneal cefepime treatment was started. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from peritoneal dialysis fluid culture and oral clarithromycin was added to the treatment. At the end of therapy, peritoneal fluid culture was negative. To our knowledge, C. jejuni peritonitis was not reported in children previously. CONCLUSION: Although C. jejuni peritonitis is rarely encountered in children, it should be considered as an etiologic factor for peritonitis.",0,847
335,"Rothia mucilaginosa (R. mucilaginosa), formerly named Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, is a facultatively anaerobic, encapsulated gram-positive coccus, which forms part of the normal oropharyngeal and is rarely considered to be a pathogen in immunocompetent patients, although it can produce, on rare occasions, serious infections like bacteremia, endocarditis and respiratory infections; such as pneumonia, pleural empyema or superinfection of bronchiectasis. We present the case of a 74-year-old male diagnosed with right basal pneumonia of torpid evolution with a poor initial response to different antibiotics, with clinical and radiological worsening and the appearance of bilateral bronchopneumonia with pseudonodular images. R. mucilaginosa in pure culture was isolated in three sputum cultures and in bronchial suction. The patient was finally treated with Linezolid with a good clinical response and normalisation of the thorax radiography, confirming the disappearance of R. mucilaginosa in subsequent sputum cultures. As there are few documented cases of pneumonia due to R. mucilaginosa, we believe that presenting this case will be of interest.",0,1153
336,"The diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery as a late complication after orthopaedic surgery is uncommon. The causes of the injury of the artery may be due to the intervention technique itself (mainly the orthopaedic materials or the use of clips), and less frequently by fragments displaced by the trochanter. A case of pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery by a less displaced trochanter fragment is presented in this article, showing how the different professionals interacted, and with the intervention of specialists in angioradiology to resolve it.",0,573
337,"OBJECTIVES: Since 1999, we have performed implantations of Remeex(R) adjustable prosthetics as rescue treatment for complex or persistent stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after failure of other surgical treatments (Burch colposuspension, Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK) or tension-free transvaginal tape [TVT] until 2003 and transobturator tape [TOT] since 2003). We present the results of our series, which include cases with severe complications. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective study of women diagnosed with complex or refractory SUI who underwent Remeex((R)) implantation between October 1999 and December 2013. In 5 cases, we conducted cystocele correction in the same operation as the placement of the Remeex((R)). RESULTS: Sixty women, with a mean age of 66.87 years (range 39-85), underwent operations. The procedure was successful in 68.33% of the cases. The failures consisted of the following: 10% of the women had mixed urinary incontinence (UI) with multiple bladder diverticula; 8.33% had mild SUI; and 13.33% had urgency urination without UI. Thirty-five percent required adjustments. We recorded 3 cases with severe complications: disabling severe UI in a patient who underwent multiple operations, massive pelvic hemorrhage in a patient undergoing standard antiplatelet therapy and infected vaginal calculi measuring 7cm on an extruding Remeex thread in a paraplegic patient 4 years after the implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Remeex((R)) is an effective and safe procedure for achieving continence in cases of complex or refractory SUI, although it is not exempt from severe complications. Following rigorous protocols can help detect complications and treat them in a timely manner.",0,1698
338,"Strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis, which can be asymptomatic and means a high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts, severe malnutrition and coinfection with HTLV-1 virus. The parasite has the potential to produce and multiply internal autoinfection in humans, thus an hyperinfection can be developed. A case of pulmonary infection by this parasite is presented in this study, infection which advanced into a respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic support in an intensive care unit. The standard treatment combined with ivermectin and albendazole was provided, achieving an appropriate response.",0,689
339,"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a medical condition which was identified for the first time in 2004 and affects chronic users of cannabis. It is characterized by cyclic episodes of uncontrollable vomiting as well as compulsive bathing in hot water. The episodes have a duration of two to four days. The vomiting is recognizable by a lack of response to regular antiemetic treatment, and subsides only with cannabis abstinence, reappearing in periods of consumption of this substance. The etiology of this syndrome is unknown. Up until June 2014, 83 cases of CHS were published worldwide, four of them in Spain.The first patient of CHS at Mataro Hospital was diagnosed in 2012. Since then, five new cases have been identified. The average duration between the onset of acute CHS episodes and diagnosis is 6.1 years, similar to that observed in previously published cases, an average of 3.1 years. This ""delay"" of CHS diagnosis demonstrates a lack of awareness with respect to this medical condition in the healthcare profession.With the objective of providing information concerning CHS and facilitating its timely diagnosis, a series of six new cases of CHS diagnosed in Mataro Hospital is presented along with a summary of cases published between 2004 and June 2014.",0,1277
340,"Pott's disease is a health problem in developing countries and its diagnosis in children is a challenge. Here we present the case of a two-year-old boy with Pott's disease involving T1 to T3 thoracic vertebrae. The clinical presentation was characterized by difficulty walking, fever, cough, and dyspnea. At physical examination, kyphosis and bony prominence were observed in the cervicodorsal area. A positive tuberculin test was obtained, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated via culture of the gastric aspiration sample. The spine MRI showed a chronic abscess, destruction of two vertebrae, and bone marrow compression. The patient experienced some improvement with anti-TB therapy. Here, we emphasize the importance of giving consideration to the clinical suspicion for the early detection of this condition, as well as a quick TB-treatment start so as to avoid the disability and mortality associated to this disease.",0,929
341,"Head and neck paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors expressing somatostatin receptors on their cell surface, particularly subtype 2. Due to this distinctive feature, images can be obtained in Nuclear Medicine using synthetic analogues of somatostatin, mainly octreotide, which allow selective display by planar scintigraphy, SPECT-CT or PET-CT imaging after radiolabeling with (111)In or (68)Ga. Three cases have been selected and presented from a series of patients that illustrate the utility of SPECT-CT studies with (111)In-octreotide in the diagnosis and monitoring of this type of tumor. These are characterization at initial diagnosis, staging, and detection of local recurrence or metastasis, with added value with respect to anatomical images (nuclear magnetic resonance, computed axial tomography, angiography), for example in the differentiation between functional tissue or scar in patients who had previously undergone surgery.",0,948
342,"BACKGROUND: Primary posterior perineal hernias in men are rare. We report a case of this type of hernia associated with dolichocolon, a condition which, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously. CLINICAL CASE: A 71-year old male presenting with a perineal tumour of 40 years evolution. He had no history of perineal surgery or trauma. On physical examination, a lump of 4x3cm was observed in the right para-anal region, which increased in volume during the Valsalva manoeuvre. Computed tomography showed a defect in the pelvic floor, which was reconstructed using a roll of polypropylene mesh in the hernia defect. DISCUSSION: The case described is of interest, not only because a perineal hernia is a rare clinical entity, but also because repair using a roll of mesh has not been reported associated with a dolichocolon, which can be considered a factor risk for development. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical approach and repair technique of the pelvic floor for perineal hernias should be individualised. The use of mesh for reconstruction should always be considered. The presence of dolichocolon can contribute to the gradual development of a perineal hernia.",0,1167
343,"Encephaloceles are uncommon in western countries and most cases are located in the occipital bone. Frontal encephaloceles may involve the ethmoid bone, nasal bones and/or the orbits. Surgical repair is complex and usually requires a multidisciplinary approach. The goal of the surgery is to reconstruct the normal anatomy, to achieve a good cosmetic repair and to avoid a cerebrospinal fluid leak. We present a case of a patient with a large congenital frontoethmoidal encephalocele. Autologous calvarian bone grafts were used to repair of encephalocele defect and for the reconstruction of the frontonasal area. The defect closure and the cosmetic result were satisfactory, and the only complication detected was the infection of a previously performed ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A description of the technique and a review of the literature are presented.",0,858
344,"Angelman syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by a lack or reduction of expression of UBE3A located within chromosome 15, which codes for ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, which has a key role in synaptic development and neural plasticity. Its main features are developmental delay/intellectual disability, lack of speech, a characteristic behavioural profile, and epilepsy. We describe clinical features and management of seven cases with 15q11-13 deletion. Due to their life expectancy, knowing and managing its comorbidities is crucial to improve their quality of life. We review the diagnosis and long-term clinical care of patients with Angelman syndrome.",0,662
345,"The marijuana arteriopathy should be considered in young patients with peripheral arterial disease with no risk factors for atherosclerosis. It was described for the first time in 1960 and since then there have been about 100 cases published in the literature. Although it tends to be considered as an independent entity of thromboangiitis obliterans or Leo Buerger's disease, in the light of the last findings it is possible to consider it within the spectrum of the latter. We present two cases of young patients with peripheral vascular disease associated with marijuana use where other associated illnesses had been excluded and where the mainstay of treatment has been the cessation of marijuana consumption. It is essential to assess drug use in young patients presenting with peripheral arterial disease.",0,811
346,"We present the case of an 81-year-old woman who was followed up by the Rheumatology Service for osteoporosis and treated with bisphosphonates for more than five years. She reported a fracture of the distal third of the contralateral femur by a low energy mechanism, treated with retrograde intramedullary nailing the previous year. She presented a clinic of cruralgia and left gonalgia, without previous trauma. A scintigraphy and radiographs were performed to support the diagnosis of stress fracture of the distal third of the left femur and osteonecrosis of the left internal femoral condyle. Thinking about the possible complications of performing two interventions in an elderly patient, we decided to complete the treatment in a single time and by the same surgical approach, trying to resolve the osteonecrosis and the fracture at the same time, with the objective of an early rehabilitation and lower morbidity. A femoral retrograde prophylactic nailing was performed to stabilize the stress fracture and a retentive primary knee prosthesis was implanted for the posterior cruciate ligament by the same surgical approach. There were no incidents in the immediate postoperative period, with ambulation beginning with help 48 hours after the intervention. The fracture consolidated and the patient presented a good functional result of the knee, both in the immediate postoperative period and at three years of follow-up.",0,1427

We present the case of a 19-year-old woman, without comorbidities and normal development that started at 8 years with seizures and that from 15 years, had progressive cognitive deterioration. She was admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of super refractory status epilepticus. The diagnosis of Lafora's disease was made through pathological anatomy, later a genetic test was performed that reported a pathogenic variant of the EPM2A gene, confirming the diagnosis. We present a cause of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, with an ominous prognosis and a treatment oriented to palliative measures, so it is important to analyze the differential diagnoses with other entities, in order to establish a prognosis, offer better quality of life, adequate medical care and provide genetic counseling to family members.",0,928
348,"Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) is composed of three segments from different embryological origin. Its lack of fusion originates a wide spectrum of anomalies of the IVC. These malformations are present in 0.07-8.7% of the population. It is generally diagnosed as an incidental finding in adult life. It represents between 5 and 9.5% of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis in patients younger than 30 years old without associated risk factors. We present a case of a term newborn with prenatal diagnosis of ascites during the 20th week of gestation. IVC Agenesis was diagnosed with the use of abdominal angiotomography. The treatment of patients with IVC Agenesis is based on the management of its complications. Due to the increased thrombotic risk of these patients, we should consider lifelong anticoagulation. We suggest initiating it during puberty.",0,842
349,"Neurotoxicity caused by cefepime may occur predominantly in patients with impaired renal function. A case of a cefepime-induced non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is presented. A 65-year-old woman suffered a severe NCSE due to cefepime in the presence of acute renal failure, requiring coma induction with sodium thiopental. A serious interaction between valproic acid (VPA) and meropenem was also produced after changing cefepime to meropenem. Continuous veno-venous haemofiltration was employed to improve cefepime clearance, and the patient progressively regained her previous mental condition. In conclusion, the cefepime dose must be adjusted according to renal function in order to avoid toxicity in patients with renal failure. Electroencephalogram should be considered in cases of acute confusional state in patients receiving cefepime, to achieve early detection of NCSE. Continuous renal replacement therapy may be successfully employed in severe cases in order to accelerate cefepime removal. Likewise, meropenem should not be used concomitantly with VPA.",0,1072
350,"D-lactic acidosis is an infrequent complication, mainly reported in patients with short bowel syndrome. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of encephalopathy with elevated serum D-lactic acid, usually associating metabolic acidosis. The presence of D-lactate-producing bacteria is necessary for the development of this complication. Other factors, such as the ingestion of large amounts of carbohydrates or reduced intestinal motility, contribute to D-lactic acidosis. We report a case of recurrent D-lactic acidosis in a 5-year-old girl with short bowel syndrome, due to a midgut volvulus. She initially received oral antibiotics in order to treat bacterial overgrowth, together with oral carbohydrates restriction. Nevertheless, recurrences did occur. Subsequently, 25% of the enteral nutrition was replaced for a formula containing fructose exclusively, while other fermentable sugars were restricted from the diet. After 16 years of follow up, further recurrences of D-lactic acidosis were not observed.",0,1013
351,"Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been widely used in the adult patient, contrary to what happens in children, with just a few long series papers. NPWT avoids long and expensive hospital admissions, reducing the hospital costs; it also decreases the family dynamics and allows for an early return to everyday activities. In this article, we present three clinical cases consisting of a toddler, a child and a teenager with complex wounds treated with NPWT in the pediatric surgery department of the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital in Granada. The results were excellent, with a good adherence to treatment in all cases, achieving a complete closure in two cases; the third case needed a deferred surgical closure after surgical site preparation, and showed a decrease of the wound size after the NPWT. Moreover, successful pain management was achieved during the wound cleansing, which was done under an ambulatory regime. No general anesthesia was needed. From our experience, we propose the NPWT as an alternative therapy to the classic surgical approach for this type of complex lesions in children, which offers the same advantages and results than in adults.",0,1181
352,"A case is presented on a patient who underwent left single lung transplantation for emphysema type COPD. There was early graft dysfunction gradeiii during the immediate postoperative period, which required the implantation of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). Respirator ventilatory parameters were adjusted to avoid lung distension, low tidal volume (Vc) (280ml), high respiratory rates (20rpm), and a positive pressure at end expiration (PEEP) level of 8cmH2O. On monitoring the pulmonary tidal volume distribution by bedside electrical impedance tomography (EIT), it was noted that most of the tidal volume was distributed in the native lung emphysema. An alveolar recruitment manoeuvre was performed, under control of the EIT, that enabled the current volume and distribution and the pressures required to ventilate the transplanted lung to be observed.",0,869
354,"Pneumococcal meningitis produces several inflammatory disorders in susceptible subjects. A worsening of meningitis can occur on the fourth day of evolution in relation with the withdrawal of steroids. Other complications include the development of inflammatory signs in the post-acute stage of infection associated with disseminated vasculitis of the cerebral blood vessels and, even later, an autoimmune chronic meningitis. All these inflammatory complications are well controlled with the use of steroids. We report a 53-year-old woman with pneumococcal meningitis that had a good response to treatment with antibiotics and steroids. On the four day, after the steroids were discontinued, she complained of headache, became confused, and had an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), report CT angiography showed signs of arteritis. She improved when the steroids were re-started. She was discharged in good condition but after slow tapering of the steroids over a four-month period she had a relapse of all her symptoms and had a gait disturbance. On readmission, she had an inflammatory CSF, there were no signs of infection and the cerebral MRI showed meningeal thickening with ventricular space enlargement. She improved again with steroids and she is now well on high-dose steroids but deteriorates each time the steroids are stopped. She experienced both acute and sub-acute inflammatory responses and finally developed a chronic meningitis responsive, and is dependent on steroids.",0,1487
355,"Anthrax is a zoonosis caused by a spore-forming bacterium, called Bacillus anthracis. Naturally it is of global distribution, with a predilection in agricultural zones with few norms of public veterinary health. Human contagion occurs through the consumption of diseased animal's meat or through a doorway into the skin or through the spores inhalation of products derived from the affected animal (wool, leather, bones). The most frequent infection in humans occurs in the skin, followed by the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. We present the last outbreak of cutaneous anthrax diagnosed in Chile with a description of the first two clinical cases of the outbreak. Control disease is based on prevention, hence the importance of surveillance in detecting cases and outbreaks.",0,777
356,"The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has increased in the last decade. The anesthetic management of these patients in upper abdomen surgery is a challenge to the anesthesiologist, since general anesthesia is associated with a high possibility of severe pulmonary complications. The search for a suitable alternative has been a subject of study for years. The case is presented of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who required an urgent cholecystectomy. The treatment of the case and brief review of the literature is presented.",0,566
357,"INTRODUCTION: The giant-cell tumor is an aggressive neoplasia, represents approximately from the 5 the 8.6% of primary bone tumors; more of 50% affects the pelvic extremity, being able to affect the totality of the bones. OBJECTIVE: To present the case series of tumors around the knee and hip that we offered a tumoral joint replacement as an alternative to amputation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present eight cases of extensive giant cells tumors, we did en bloc resection and tumoral joint replacement. RESULTS: The clinical and radiological evolution was satisfactory, without postoperative complications and the most important, avoided an amputation with a better quality of life. DISCUSSION: Alternative reconstructive treatment option with a recovery to its normal life in a 80% and a low index of complications.",0,818
358,"Congenital melanocytic nevus syndrome (CMNS) is the result of an abnormal proliferation of melanocytes in the skin and central nervous system caused by progenitor-cell mutations during embryonic development. Mutations in the NRAS gene have been detected in many of these cells. We present 5 cases of giant congenital melanocytic nevus, 3 of them associated with CMNS; NRAS gene mutation was studied in these 3 patients. Until a few years ago, surgery was the treatment of choice, but the results have proved unsatisfactory because aggressive interventions do not improve cosmetic appearance and only minimally reduce the risk of malignant change. In 2013, trametinib was approved for use in advanced melanoma associated with NRAS mutations. This drug, which acts on the intracellular RAS/RAF/MEK/pERK/MAPK cascade, could be useful in pediatric patients with CMNS. A better understanding of this disease will facilitate the development of new strategies.",0,953
359,"OBJECTIVE: Calciphylaxis is a potentially lethal syndrome reported mainly in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. Etiopathogenesis remains unclear and there is much controversy regarding optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Penile necrosis as a disease presentation is extremely rare. We report two clinical cases treated in our center and perform an evidence review. METHODS: Clinical data was obtained from both patients and an evidence review was performed on PubMed under the criteria ""penile necrosis"" and ""Calciphylaxis"". RESULTS: Both patients underwent partial penectomy due to severe penile necrosis. After surgery both patients received treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) 20mg in every hemodialysis session. Both patients showed stabilization of necrotic lesions. DISCUSSION: The same way that biopsying the ischemic lesions produced by Calciphylaxis is discussed and even misadvised, the role of aggressive surgery as first line therapy might be uncertain specially with the raising of new specific drugs such as sodium thiosulfate (STS) that have shown efficacy stopping disease progression.",0,1115

361,"Hydatidosis is a parasitic infection caused by the Echinococcus granulosus larvae, transmitted by the ingestion of infected food, characterized by the formation of cysts in vital organs. In Argentina, the disease is spread throughout the territory, constituting an important public health issue. The disease usually affects the liver and lungs. The affection of other organs is rare, and even more uncommon the affection of the heart. We present the case of a disseminated hydatidosis in a pediatric patient, whose initial clinical manifestation was an acute arterial embolism of the right limb caused by the rupture of a hydatidic cardiac cyst.",0,645
362,"INTRODUCTION: Isolated optic nerve metastases are extremely uncommon. Many cases are associated with involvement from locations such as the choroid, orbit, or central nervous system. Optic nerve metastases often have their origin in primary tumours of the breast, lung, and stomach, in adults. CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 57 year-old woman with a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Her first complaint was a sudden loss of visual acuity in her right eye. The diagnosis of optic nerve metastases was made based on her history, and the results of the MRI scan. DISCUSSION: Isolated optic nerve metastases are an uncommon condition, but should be suspected in any patient with a history of oncology who has deteriorated visual acuity.",0,742
363,"Gnathostomiasis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by some species of helminthes belonging to the genus Gnathostoma . It has a wide clinical presentation and its diagnosis is a challenge. Tropical and subtropical countries are endemic, and its transmission is associated with eating raw or undercooked meat from fresh water animals. Increasing global tourism and consuming exotic foods have produced a noticeable rise in cases of the disease in the last decades. However, in our country, there has not been any confirmed case of gnathostomiasis previously reported. We present the case of a 63-year-old Colombian man with an international travel history, who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. During the hospital stay, he developed a cutaneous lesion on the upper right abdominal quadrant, where later, a larva was found. A morphological study allowed us to identify it as Gnathostoma spinigerum . As such, this is the first report of an imported case of gnathostomiasis confirmed in Colombia. This article describes the principles, etiology, pathogenic cycle and treatment of this disease with special considerations to our patient s particular features.",0,1159
364,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is an uncommon skin eruption, characterized by fever and the rapid onset of disseminated, non-follicular, sterile pustules, over an erythematous skin background. It is usually classified as a severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction, whose most relevant triggers are antibiotics and anticonvulsants. However, viral and bacterial infections have also rarely been associated with this dermatosis. We report the case of a patient, who developed lesions of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis as an extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.",0,607

We review the literature and the utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in the initial staging.",0,529
369,"CASE REPORT: Two cases of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis are presented. Immunosuppressive therapy was required to control the uveitis. Contrary to that usually described, uveitis became chronic, which made immunosuppressive therapy necessary. Nephritis was successfully treated with steroids. DISCUSSION: Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome is an under-diagnosed disorder and requires clinical suspicion due to there being no specific laboratory study available. Recurrences and relapses of ocular inflammation are common. Immunosuppressive therapy is not often needed.",0,593
370,"OBJECTIVE: Metastatic involvement in the port site used to perform laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) is very infrequent. METHODS: We report the case of a patient with port site and peritoneal metastasis after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy. RESULTS: 60-year-old male with a history of LRP due to Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate adenocarcinoma with posterior salvage radiotherapy after biochemical recurrence. Appearance of metastatic lesion at one of the laparoscopic port site followed by third left rib and peritoneal metastasis, treated with local excision and subsequent hormonotherapy and chemotherapy (HT+QT). CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic extension of prostate adenocarcinoma at a port site after performing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a highly exceptional situation. The elevation of PSA levels and image tests (PET-CT) help in the diagnosis. Histopathological confirmation must be performed using Fine Needle Aspiration(FNA). Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant therapy (HT+QT) can help complete the treatment scheme.",0,1084

372,"Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery for chronic open-angle glaucoma treatment tries to reduce the amount of chronic topical drug treatment, delaying invasive glaucoma surgery and diminishing the number of surgical complications. XEN45 uses subconjunctival drainage in order to reduce intraocular pressure. The report is presented of a patient following phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation and XEN45 implant. After four days acute malignant glaucoma was observed, with stage 3 athalamia requiring pars plana vitrectomy and secondary Ahmed valve implantation. The lower rate of complications due to minimally invasive glaucoma surgery has increased its use. Nevertheless, it is not free of severe adverse events, even requiring a multidisciplinary approach as in our malignant glaucoma report.",0,806
373,"Upgaze or sustained elevation of the eyes, is an alteration of ocular motility initially described in hypoxic coma. We report a 65-year-old woman admitted with hypotension and alteration of sensorium due to the ingestion of 9.5 g of Bupropion. She presented two seizures of short duration, without epileptic activity on the EEG. She had a persistent asynchronous myoclonus in extremities, tachycardia and prolonged Q-t. She suffered a cardiac arrest caused by asystole, which recovered quickly in five minutes. At that moment, upgaze appeared, associated with a persistent ocular opening, which persisted for days, but finally disappeared, without remission of coma. A magnetic resonance imaging done at the eighth day, showed hyperintensity of the oval center and corpus callosum which disappeared in a new imaging study done 30 days later, where images of hypoxia in the basal nuclei and cortex appeared. The patient died forty seven days after admission. Up-gaze is an ominous oculomotor alteration linked to an important but incomplete damage in the cerebral cortex, a condition that perverts some sequences of the ocular opening, reversing the Bell phenomenon and producing eyelid retraction.",0,1197
374,"CLINICAL CASE: An uncommon case is presented of a 15 year-old girl with bilateral, multiple serous detachments of retina and retinal pigment epithelium. With clinical and laboratory (IgG 1/160 and IgM 1/160, using an indirect immunofluorescence assay) diagnoses of leptospirosis, a complete ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography were performed, and the patient was followed for two years. DISCUSSION: Bilateral, multiple serous detachments of retina and retinal pigment epithelium can be a complication of systemic leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira. Without a detailed medical history it may be underdiagnosed, mainly because it can mimic other more common diseases. It may be prudent to ask patients regarding contact with pets.",0,811
375,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a major causative agent of acute diarrhea in children in developing countries. This pathotype is divided into typical EPEC (tEPEC) and atypical EPEC (aEPEC), based on the presence of the bfp virulence factor associated with adhesion, encoded in the pEAF plasmid. In the present study, the isolation of aEPEC O157:H16 from a bloody diarrhea case in a child and his household contacts (mother, father and sister) is described. The strain was characterized as E. coli O157:H16 eae-varepsilon-positive, sorbitol fermenter with beta-glucuronidase activity, susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, and negative for virulence factors stx1, stx2, ehxA and bfp. XbaI-PFGE performed on all isolates showed the AREXHX01.1040 macrorestriction pattern, with 100% similarity. These results highlight the importance of epidemiological surveillance of E. coli O157-associated diarrhea cases identified in children and their family contacts, as well as the incorporation of molecular techniques that allow the detection of the different E. coli pathotypes.",0,1085

377,"BACKGROUND: Gallstone ileus is caused by the exit of a gallstone from the gallbladder or bile duct into the small intestine, resulting in bowel obstruction if this stone becomes lodged in a small bowel loop. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 78 year-old woman with an episode of intestinal obstruction. After studying the main cause of the obstruction, it was decided to perform a laparotomy where a gallstone located in the terminal ileum was causing the obstruction. No fistula was observed between the gallbladder and the bile duct and the intestinal tract. It is important to note the history of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography performed a few months earlier, as it would probably be the cause of the passage of the gallstone to the small bowel. CONCLUSION: Few reports of gallstone ileus have been described in the literature after performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. In these cases, the intestinal obstruction usually occurs several months after the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, so the diagnosis is often delayed. Surgery is usually the definitive treatment and it consists of the removal the stone by enterotomy and performing a cholecystectomy. Biliary enteric fistula repair is not necessary since this does not form.",0,1297
378,"INTRODUCTION: Hirayama disease is a rare cervical myelopathy, predominantly affecting young males, which presents with distal atrophy of the upper limbs as its first and main symptom. It must be differentiated from motor neuron diseases because its natural history is different and because HD tends to stabilise in less than 5 years. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and dynamic flexion MRI showing segmental spinal muscular atrophy, detachment of the posterior dura mater and venous congestion in the epidural space. The tendency is to indicate conservative treatment and no indications for surgery have been established. PATIENTS: We present 4 cases meeting both clinical criteria and dynamic MRI imaging criteria for a diagnosis of Hirayama disease. Two have stabilised spontaneously over the course of many years, and MRI scans show that typical changes have disappeared. Another case also remains stable following a shorter observation time. The fourth case is a young man who developed severe myelopathy in just over a year, and therefore underwent surgery. While his follow-up time is still short, his condition remains stable. CONCLUSIONS: Our 4 cases suggest that the condition of most patients with Hirayama stabilises naturally; patients should be evaluated for surgery on an individual basis, and surgery should probably be limited to the most severe cases that have progressed quickly.",0,1405
379,"BACKGROUND: functional bowel disorders are characterized by an absence of structural or biochemical damage, but can lead to chronic diarrhea and intestinal malabsorption. If not properly treated, they predispose to a state of malnutrition that, depending on the underlying pathologies, could affect the evolution of other concomitant diseases. CASE REPORT: the relevance of this case stems from the fact that our 43-year-old patient, with multiple comorbidities, with progressive weight and muscle mass loss, after five years of inefficiency in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, achieves, on a peptide enteral formula basis, a good nutritional status and quality of life, which finally leads to the control of the chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. DISCUSSION: in the unintentional weight loss caused by long-term functional diarrhea, the choice of a peptide diet may have a fundamental role for a satisfactory patient's progress.",0,931

381,May-Thurner syndrome is an anatomic abnormality that predisposes patients to increase risk of paradoxical embolism and stroke. It consists of chronic compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery and lumbar spine. This may lead to deep venous thrombosis and paradoxical embolism that could provoke cerebral ischemia in patients with a cardiac shunt from right-to-left. Embolic cerebral ischemic event is reported in a 30-year-old man after sexual intercourse. Further studies revea led suggestive findings of May-Thurner syndrome coupled with a patent foramen ovale and a factor V Leiden thrombophilia. He was placed on anticoagulation therapy and has not had any recurrent events.,0,720
382,"BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts of spine are a very rare occurrence. The aetiology still remains unclear, but the most accepted explanation is the existence of areas of weakness in the spinal dura. Symptoms depend on the location in the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging is used for its diagnosis. Management depends of clinical presentation, and the surgery is reserved for patients with neurological impairment. CLINICAL CASE: A case is described of 67 year-old male with myelopathy and radiculopathy symptoms, both diagnosed simultaneously. The magnetic resonance imaging was used to diagnose a thoracolumbar extradural arachnoid cyst from T12-L2 and lumbar spinal canal stenosis. The patient was treated with a puncture procedure to empty the cyst and decompress the neural elements. There was a clinical improvement of myelopathy syndrome after puncture procedure. One month later, the patient underwent a minimally invasive surgical approach to decompress the neural elements in lumbar spine, achieving improvement of the radiculopathy syndrome and neurogenic claudication in both legs. CONCLUSION: There is currently no standard minimally invasive approach to surgically treat these cysts, but if the patient has mild symptoms, clinical observation is recommended.",0,1267

384,"We present the case of a 68 year-old male patient with secondary intestinal intussuspection due to a submucous li-poma of the ileum. This is a rare entity in adults and is usually due to an organic lesion. The clinical manifestation is characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain and melenas. In our case the patient, following a colonoscopy and an abdominal CT-scan, was subjected to an extended resection of caecum and terminal ilium. At present, the precision of the etiological diagnosis of intussuspections has increased thanks to the development of image tests, like CT-scan. Early surgical treatment is recommended, without intraoperative deintussuspection given the high risk of presenting a malign or ischemic lesion in the adult.",0,737
385,"The secondary hemophagocytic syndrome is rare in children and even rarer associated with tuberculosis. e report the case of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, disseminated tuberculosis and hemophagocytic syndrome.

She presented abdominal distension, dehydration, tachypnea, crackles and wheezing in both lungs, anemia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. She received broad-spectrum antibiotics and exploratory laparotomy was performed with appendectomy and lymph node biopsy. After 72 hours the patient presented tonic clonic seizure, impaired sensory, fever, hypoxemia, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and peripheral edema. She developed bicytopenia, hyperferritinemia and bone marrow microscopic examination with hemophagocytosis. She received intravenous gammaglobulin, steroids and blood transfusions.

388,"Fusarium species are a group of fungi that cause superficial infections, locally invasive and disseminated disease, which occur mainly in immunocompromised hosts, and occasionally in immunocompetent individuals. We present three cases that show three different clinical forms of Fusarium spp. disease that affected different types of patients (patients with hematological malignancy, chronic kidney disease in peritoneal dialysis and post-surgical for osteoarticular pathology), each with its own characteristics that merit discussion. These cases show different clinical forms of invasive fusariosis caused by Fusarium solani complex species in patients with different pathologies and therapeutic management that could be risk factors for the development of the disease. The clinical recognition of fusariosis, not only in oncohematological patients, together with a timely diagnosis and treatment contribute to the success of the treatment and a reduction in mortality.",0,971
389,"Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a rare benign idiopathic condition characterized by acquired macular pigmentation of lips and buccal mucosa, often accompanied with melanonychia. The main concern with this condition is to rule out other differential diagnosis with systemic repercussions and similar hyperpigmentation patterns, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, adrenal insufficiency and melanoma. We report a 58-year-old female with a 20-year history of Sjogrens syndrome, presenting with melanonychia and hyperpigmentation in the buccal mucosa. She had no relevant medication history and is a non-smoker. The patient denied any other symptoms. The histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome.",0,712

391,"We present two cases of enterovaginal and enterocutaneous fistulae associated to treatment with pazopanib, which is an angiogenesis inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer. The times from drug administration and the first appearance of a fistula were 6 and 16 months, respectively. None of the cases had a history of surgery or radiotherapy in the area where the complication was observed. Enterovaginal and enterocutaneous fistula represent less than 1% of all published complications caused by the use of antiangiogenic drugs. However, they must be taken into account as the reported mortality rate is close to 30%. Given its low incidence, we believe that sharing this data is a great way to help specialists who have to treat these patients to take the necessary precautions and decide on an adequate approach.",0,829
392,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease. Most people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 33-year-old female working as a critical care nurse. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a MERS-COV patient. Although the patient was in respiratory failure, necessitated mechanical ventilation, and intensive care (ICU) admission, a healthy infant was delivered. The mother recovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in a pregnant woman. CONCLUSIONS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) known to cause severe acute respiratory illness associated with a high risk of mortality Various factors may have contributed to the successful outcome of this patient such as young age, presentation during the last stages of pregnancy, and possible differences in immune response.",1,1284
393,"BACKGROUND: Schwannoma is a rare benign tumor derived from nerve sheaths. When derived from the cervical sympathetic chain, it usually presents itself as an asymptomatic mass located in the posterior cervical region, at paravertebral level. Its diagnosis is not easy, usually requiring multiple imaging tests. Its differential diagnosis includes parathyroid adenoma. CLINICAL CASE: A new case of schwannoma of the cervical sympathetic chain in a patient with a synchronous overactive parathyroid adenoma is reported. This case adds to the sixty described in the literature, although to our knowledge no association between schwannoma and parathyroid adenoma has been reported to date. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being a benign tumor, its treatment is a complete surgical resection. The most common complication after the surgery needed for these tumors is ipsilateral Horner syndrome.",0,878
394,"Brown tumours are highly vascular lytic bone lesions found in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The brown term is given due to the red-brown colour of the tissue, which is due to the accumulation of hemosiderin. The case is presented of a 29 year-old male with chronic renal failure, who had a mass in the tip of the ring finger after a trauma of 4 months onset, which had increased progressively in size and pain. He was treated surgically, by amputation, with no recurrence 10 months after the surgery.",0,513
395,"Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a rare and fatal complication in patients with HIV infection. It occurs in 3%-16% of extra pulmonary forms. The main location in 90% of cases is the ileocecal valve and colon. The most unusual presentation of gastrointestinal tuberculosis is massive bleeding with the presence of one or multiple ulcers in the colon. The diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy and by culture of intestinal tissue. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. We report a case of a HIV-infected patient, who did not receive antiretrovirals, and who developed disseminated tuberculosis with intestinal perforation, presenting a fatal massive intestinal bleeding.",0,676
396,"Diabetes mellitus occurs in nearly 10% of patients with acromegaly and is secondary to insulin resistance caused by high levels of growth hormone. Diabetes ketoacidosis has been described as a rare complication of acromegaly, resulting from a relative insulin deficiency caused by growth hormone excess. We described the case of a 38 year-old man who presented to the emergency room with a 6-week history of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weight loss. He also had nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain from two days before admission. His plasma glucose level was 880 mg/dl, plasma osmolarity 368 mOsm/l, arterial pH 7.06 and serum bicarbonate 8.6 mEq/l. At the clinical examination, he had features of acromegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a pituitary macro adenoma and growth hormone dosages were abnormally high. After tumor removal, plasma glucose levels became normal. This case shows the rare association between diabetic ketoacidosis and acromegaly. Surgery, in this case, was the definite modality of treatment.",0,1030
397,"Pulmonary embolism is one of the most severe venous thromboembolic diseases, both in mortality and the high number of associated complications and their impact on quality of life. The early hours are critical and proper management during this period can determine future sequels. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, nurses must have adequate knowledge and tools to act quickly and efficiently. In this paper, we present a case of a 77 year-old male in his home that after being discharged from a knee replacement surgery starts with symptoms compatible with pulmonary thromboembolism. A Nursing Care Process is performed, according to the functional patterns of Margory Gordon and a care plan is developed based on NNN taxonomy (NANDA, NOC, NIC). As main nursing diagnosis 'ineffective breathing pattern' is selected and as possible potential complication of the pulmonary embolism the 'pulmonary infarction' is chosen. The results obtained after conducting the care plan are satisfactory, improving the signs and symptoms presented by the patient, hence why we believe it is useful for nurses when facing similar clinical situations.",0,1136

399,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare hematological malignancy derived from immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The tumor cells have an immature blastic appearance, and diagnosis is based on the expression of CD4, CD56 y CD123 in the absence of other lymphoid, natural killer, or myeloid antigens. The majority of affected individuals are older people with a mean age of 66 years. Male to female ratio is approximately 3:1. Common presentation includes cutaneous lesions followed by tumor dissemination. Treatment with conventional chemotherapy is ineffective and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required to achieve remission. We report three male patients, aged 23, 27 and 51 years with the disease. All had multiple, infiltrated pink plaques and nodules on the skin of their face, neck and thorax, measuring 1 to 12 cm in diameter. All tumors were histologically characterized by a monotonous proliferation of medium size cells with blastic features. Tumor cells were positive for CD123, CD56, CD4 and CD7 in all cases. After a mean of follow-up of 14.6 months, one patient died of the disease, one patient is alive and the disease relapsed after 17 months of remission and one patient is alive with no evidence of the disease.",0,1271
400,"Antecedentes: La endometriosis es la presencia de glandulas endometriales o estroma viable fuera de la cavidad uterina, que afecta aproximadamente al 2-10% de las mujeres en edad reproductiva(1). Es comun la afeccion de estructuras pelvicas, incluyendo el intestino. La perforacion del colon por endometriosis es muy rara y representa una urgencia quirurgica. Caso clinico: Mujer de 28 anos con cuadro de dolor abdominal en fosa iliaca derecha y hueco pelvico, fiebre y nauseas. Se realiza laparotomia exploradora con hallazgo de perforacion de colon sigmoides, que requiere reseccion de la lesion y colostomia terminal, encontrando como diagnostico definitivo endometriosis. Conclusion: La perforacion de intestino o de colon es una complicacion poco frecuente, pero de gravedad, que debemos tener siempre presente como sospecha ante un cuadro de abdomen agudo en una paciente en edad fertil y con antecedentes de haber presentado sintomatologia gastrointestinal intermitente. Background: Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands or viable stroma outside the uterine cavity, which affects approximately 2-10% of women of reproductive age 1. Pelvic structures, including the bowel, are commonly affected. Perforation of the colon by endometriosis is very rare and represents a surgical emergency. Clinical case: A 28-year-old female patient with abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa and pelvic cavity, fever and nausea, exploratory laparotomy is performed with the discovery of sigmoid perforation of the colon, requiring resection of the lesion and terminal colostomy, finding as definitive diagnosis endometriosis. Conclusion: Bowel or colon perforation is a rare but serious complication, which should always be kept in mind as a suspicion of acute abdomen in a female patient of reproductive age and with a history of intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms.",0,1875
401,"Primary melanoma of the urinary bladder is rare. We report a case of a 58-year-old woman, who presented with a 4 month history of dysuria and hematuria. A biopsy indicated a diagnosis of invasive melanoma and a partial cystectomy was performed. The neoplasm had invaded the entire thickness of the bladder wall and the neoplastic cells were positive for Melan A and HMB-45. Four months later a urinary bladder measuring 13x7x5cm was sent for histopathology. Melanoma, melanosis and a melanocytic nevus were seen; the latter was confirmed by the positivity to melanocytic markers of non-atypical cells in both the urothelial basal layer and areas distant from the tumour. The patient died nine months later.",0,706
402,"Dermatosis characterized by tissue eosinophilia arising in the context of hematologic disease is known as eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. The most commonly associated malignancy is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy is a rare condition with a wide variety of clinical presentations, ranging from papules, erythematous nodules, or blisters that simulate arthropod bites, to the formation of true plaques of differing sizes. Histology reveals the presence of abundant eosinophils. We present 4 new cases seen in Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, Valencia, during the past 7 years. Three of these cases were associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 1 with mycosis fungoides. It is important to recognize this dermatosis as it can indicate progression of the underlying disease, as was the case in 3 of our patients.",0,878
403,"Ganciclovir has shown in vitro anti-human herpesvirus-8 activity, Kaposi sarcoma agent. We analyzed all Kaposi sarcoma patients from 1985 to 1996 pre-HAART era and identified Kaposi sarcoma/AIDS patients who achieved complete remission prior to HAART use. RESULTS: We saw 155 Kaposi sarcoma patients up to 1996, 150 with enough information, only 12 received ganciclovir, eight of them for >/= 21 days; four died within 16 weeks of ganciclovir administration. We identified four male patients with extensive Kaposi sarcoma with complete remission achieved after ganciclovir for CMV end-organ disease. Complete remission was achieved (9, 5, 10 and 5 months) after ganciclovir, which persisted even after antiretroviral therapy failure. All received two nucleosides and indinavir was later added with irregular compliance. The CD4 counts when ganciclovir was started: 11 (4%), 60 (5%), 127 (14%), and 38 (3%) and when they achieved complete remission: 37 (4%), 109 (9%), 313 (13%) and 136 (9%), respectively. Two patients died with no Kaposi sarcoma relapse three years later, with wasting syndrome and other pulmonary-embolism seven years later. One was lost to follow-up in complete remission in the year 2000, the other was alive in 2014 with 27% 820 CD4 cells/ml. The use of ganciclovir was statistically significantly associated with Kaposi sarcoma remission p = 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Ganciclovir use was associated to complete remission of Kaposi sarcoma in the pre-HAART era.",0,1477
404,"We present the case of a 34 year-old man, HIV-positive, who had suffered a disseminated histoplasmosis treated with amphotericin B one year before his admission. He was admitted at the Infectious Diseases Muniz Hospital with a non-lithiasic chlolecystitis. During the clinical examination perigenital skin lesions compatible with tinea cruris, as well as proximal subungual onychomycoses of toenails, were observed. Microsporum gypseum was isolated from both types of lesions. Oral terbinafine led to a good clinical response. Treatment prescription was a big challenge in this patient because he was receiving HAART and itraconazole, and there was scarce experience in the treatment of nail infections due to M. gypseum.",0,721
405,"This case presentation is about an 88 years-old male patient with previous endovascular aortic aneurysm repairment history and aortic endoleak type II (EL2). The direct lumbar artery catheterization was considered an alternative to solve EL2, associated with aortic endovascular prosthesis and due to an incomplete sealing or exclusion of the aneurysmal sac or a vascular segment demonstrated by imaging studies, when other treatment alternative failed (transarterial embolization) to control the aneurysm growing. Performing translumbar approach was decided by puncturing the artery lumbar (L4) left, previously the lumbar arteries (L4) were evaluated in the abdominal CT arterial phase to guide a puncture/access under flouroscopy control. Diagnostic angiogram clearly demonstrated the median sacral and right lumbar arteries inflow into the aneurysm sac. Transcatheter embolization with fibered platinum microcoils was performed of the median sacral artery and lumbar left and right arteries (L4), showing satisfactory endoleak devascularization.",0,1049
406,"This study presents the case of a 4-year-old healthy child admitted to the paediatric ward for suspected accidental intoxication due to ingestion of narcoleptic drugs (methylphenidate, sertraline and quetiapine), taken on a regular basis by his 8-year-old brother affected by Asperger syndrome.Intoxication can be objectively assessed by measurements of drugs and metabolites in biological matrices with short-term (blood and urine) or long-term (hair) detection windows. At the hospital, the child's blood and urine were analysed by immunoassay (confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sertraline and quetiapine and their metabolites were identified. The suspicion that the mother administered drugs chronically prompted the analysis of six, consecutive 2-cm segments of the child's hair, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, thereby accounting for ingestion over the previous 12 months. Quetiapine was found in the first four segments with a mean concentration of 1.00 ng/mg +/- 0.94 ng/mg hair while sertraline and its metabolite, desmethyl-sertraline, were found in all segments with a mean concentration of 2.65 +/- 0.94 ng/mg and 1.50 +/- 0.94 ng/mg hair, respectively. Hair analyses were negative for methylphenidate and its metabolite (ritalinic acid). Biological matrices testing for psychoactive drugs disclosed both acute and chronic intoxication with quetiapine and sertraline administered by the mother.",0,1475
407,"OBJECTIVE: To report a new case of prostatic carcinosarcoma, an uncommon and locally and distance aggressive tumor. METHOD: We analyzed one case diagnosed in our Center, from clinical and pathological diagnosis to death, describing the treatments received. RESULT: Patient presented a huge pelvic mass and a pulmonary metastasis that was treated with cystoprostatectomy and bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy with the diagnosis of carcinosarcoma of the prostate. He received 8 cycles of Docetaxel with bone progression and then 3 cycles of doxorubicin, suspending treatment due to progression. The survival was 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate carcinosarcoma is a very aggressive neoplasia that does not respond to the usual treatments of prostate cancer.",0,753
408,"Management of gastrointestinal bleeding caused by fundal varices is particularly difficult to manage. The options are: transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO). We report a 63 year-old male with a cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C and a 66 year-old female with a cirrhosis caused by a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Both patients had a gastrointestinal bleeding caused by fundal varices and were treated with sclerotherapy with cyanoacrylate assisted with BRTO. Flow was interrupted in the gastro-renal shunt by a femoral access in both patients. The male patient had a new bleeding two months later and died. In the female patient an endosonography performed nine months after the procedure showed absence of remaining varices.",0,840
409,"Due to blood derivative requirements, many patients with hemophilia were exposed to Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) before the availability of HCV testing. We report a 46-year-old male with Hemophilia A with a hepatitis virus C infection since 2004 causing a cirrhosis. Due to a hepatopulmonary syndrome, he received a liver allograph using a factor VIII replacement protocol, after eradicating the virus C. He had a good postoperative evolution, and no more factor VIII was required after transplantation until his last assessment.",0,534
410,"Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, also called epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, is a rare, vascular neoplasm usually with indolent behaviour. It was introduced in the latest World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of Soft Tissue. We report a case of a 45 year-old patient presenting with a localized, palpable and slightly painful lesion in the left arm. Histologically it consisted of fascicles of spindle and epithelioid cells with ample eosinophilic cytoplasm, without nuclear pleomorphism or significant mitotic activity. Tumour cells showed diffuse expression for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD31 and FLI1, intact expression for INI1 and negativity for CD34. We describe the clinical, histological, molecular and immunohistochemical features of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and review the pertinent literature.",0,849
411,"CASE REPORT: A male patient with an exposure keratopathy caused by lagophthalmos. A gold weight was implanted in the right upper eyelid. Eight months later, he presented with erythema and swelling of right upper eyelid. An incisional biopsy was performed, reporting extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma. DISCUSSION: when a tumour at the site of a gold weight implant is refractory to treatment, it is essential to perform an incisional biopsy to establish the histopathological diagnosis. Ocular adnexal lymphomas are relatively common. The presence of foreign material can cause chronic inflammation that could be the stimulus for the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder.",0,686
412,"Hepatic radioembolization with (90)Y is an increasingly widely used locoregional therapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Its potential benefit has recently been described as a downstaging treatment, achieving a decreased tumour burden and allowing patients to be rescued for more radical treatments, such as liver transplantation. The case is presented of a patient diagnosed with multifocal bilobar hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate stage, in whom treatment with (90)Y achieved a satisfactory radiological response with a very significant reduction of tumour burden, allowing rescue with liver transplantation.",0,667
413,"Severe congestive heart failure (CHF) patients are prone to hyponatremia. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is increasingly used for long-term management of refractory CHF patients. The glucose polymer icodextrin was proposed to be a good option for fluid removal in such patients. A small, although statistically significant reduction in serum sodium ( approximately 2mmol/l) consistently observed in multiple trials, is considered as not clinically relevant. Here we reported five refractory CHF patients who demonstrated sodium drop by median of 8meq/l (range 5.4-8.3meq/l) after icodextrin was added to their program. It seems that icodextrin may contribute to clinically relevant hyponatremia if the hyponatremia is compounded by other factors. Patients with extremely severe congestive heart failure are susceptible to this complication.",0,834
414,"The post-transplant distal limb syndrome is a not well known entity, with a prevalence of 5% in patients with renal transplant. Its diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, bone scintigraphy and MRI, it has a benign course and the patient recovers without sequel. We present the case of a 37-year-old male, with medical history of hypertension, Berger's disease in 1999 that required dialysis three times a week for four years (2009-2013) and renal transplant in 2013. The patient consults on January 2014 referring severe pain in both feet, with sudden onset; he remembers the exact date of the beginning of the pain and denies trauma, pain prevents ambulation. The bone scintigraphy shows pathological uptake in both feet with no difference between the two. Although there is no treatment for this disease, it has a benign course.",0,832
415,"This case report describes a probable unilateral accommodation spasm in a 10 year-old girl with no significant medical history. The right eye showed decreased visual acuity, 0.2 to 0.6 for far distance and 0.125 for near distance. Refraction without cycloplegia showed myopization up to -6 and cycloplegic refraction of+0.50. The patient had normal ocular motility, orthophoria, normal pupil reflex, normal anterior and posterior segments, normal optical coherence tomography. Neurophysiological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging were all normal. Treatment with atropine 1% drops for 15 days improved distance visual acuity to 0.8. Accommodation spasm is a rare condition and is usually bilateral. Imaging test are necessary because it may be associated with ocular or head trauma. Treatment consists of cycloplegic drugs (atropine, cyclopentolate); however, there is no defined guideline.",0,898
416,"Rothia muciloginosa is a member of normal flora and rarely causes invasive disease. Immunosupressed patients have increased risk for severe infection. Here, we report a male patient with relapsed neuroblastoma hospitalized for pneumonia. After clinical improvement, patient's respiratory symptoms worsened again. Rothia muciloginosa was isolated from blood culture. The worsening of respiratory symptoms can be explained by hematogenous spread of bacteria. He was successfully treated with meropenem and vancomycin for 14 days. This rarely seen bacterium is known to have high mortality rates unless treated appropriately and should be considered especially in patients with malignancy due to their immunsupressed situation.",0,724
417,"Renal carcinomas associated with translocation of transcription factors of the MiT/TFE family include, according to the latest World Health Organization classification, carcinomas with Xp11 translocation that involve the TFE3 gene and those with translocation t(6;11)(p21;q12) that affect the TFEB gene. Each one of these sub-types have well-defined clinicopathological and molecular characteristics. Currently, progress in molecular techniques has led to the description of neoplasms with molecular changes in these same genes but with alterations different to translocation. Thus, recently, cases have been published of TFEB-amplified renal carcinomas with prognoses that vary from cases associated with translocation and could therefore represent a new entity. We present a case of TFEB-amplified renal carcinoma with a full description of the clinicopathological characteristics and an updated revision of these neoplasms.",0,926
418,"Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction that includes skin eruption, haematological abnormalities, lymphadenopathy, and internal organ involvement. OBJECTIVE: Presenting a rare condition in children, to facilitate a rapid diagnostic suspicion and recognition by doctors. CASE REPORT: An 9 months old infant admitted due to a severe viral pneumonia, managed with non-invasive ventilation and ceftriaxone. Five days after stopping antibiotics, a confluent maculopapular rash appeared, which was predominantly in the trunk, face and upper extremities, combined with a fever, eosinophilia, and elevated serum levels of transaminase. She received treatment with oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids for 6 weeks, with a good outcome after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of DRESS syndrome is made using clinical criteria, laboratory values, and histopathology, if there is any query. Although it is classically caused by anticonvulsants and sulphonamides, many other drugs have been implicated. The offending drug should be immediately discontinued and the patient given supportive treatment, and systemic corticosteroids for long periods of treatment.",0,1260

There are different types of PPV according to the pigmentary nevus associated with the vascular malformation. Patients may present only the cutaneous condition or have systemic manifestations, among them, trauma, neurological and ophthalmological disorders. We report the case of a 1-year-old girl who had congenital glaucoma. On examination, we identified facial paralysis, bilateral ocular melanosis, segmental capillary vascular malformation on the face as on left trunk and extremities, and aberrant Mongolian spots on the upper back, lumbosacral area and buttocks. Due to clinical manifestation, the diagnosis of PPV was made. The patient was evaluated by Neurology, Traumatology and keeps on with ophthalmological controls.

423,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). The disease is reported mainly in adults. Data in children are scarce. The disease caused by MERS-CoV in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults. Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities. We report a new case of MERS-CoV infection in a 9-month-old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.

424,"Takayasu arteritis is an idiopathic and chronic granulomatous vasculitis manifested in the form of panaortitis, of unknown etiology, even though an autoimmune origin is postulated. It is progressive and generates, in adults and children, segmental stenosis, occlusion, dilation and / or aneurysms. Isolated gastrointestinal vasculitis without systemic involvement is rare. This case leads us to take into account the atypical abdominal manifestation of Takayasu arteritis in the differential diagnosis of a frequent symptom, such as epigastralgia, and to highlight the role currently played by non-invasive imaging methods for its diagnosis.",0,641
425,"Castleman's disease (CD) is an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown cause, characterized by non-clonal nodal hyperplastic growth. Two forms of clinical presentation are currently recognized, one localized and the other multicentric, and four histopathologic variants. It is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever and night sweats. CD may present severe pancytopenia, multi-organ failure, lymphoma evolution and it can sometimes be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes such as POEMS syndrome. Associations of these two entities have been widely described in the current literature, although its less common association with amyloidosis is described as isolated clinical cases.

427,"CASE REPORT: Here we report a 19-year-old female patient who presented a vasoproliferative tumour. It caused complications, such as epiretinal membrane, macular oedema, vitreous haemorrhage, and exudative retinal detachment. The patient was treated with 3 injections of intravitreal bevacizumab, an intravitreal dexamethasone implant, tocilizumab, and double freeze-thaw cryotherapy. DISCUSSION: Therapeutic options are: observation, if it is small, if it is a peripheral lesion, and if there seems to be no threat to vision. If it requires treatment, laser photocoagulation, intravitreal bevacizumab, trans-conjunctival cryotherapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy plaques and surgery are the different options available.

428,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare form of primary immunodeficiency disease, characterized by an abnormal susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, and it is caused by a deficit in the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex (NADPH), resulting in the inability to generate reactive oxygen species that destroy microorganisms. The diagnosis is based on clinical characteristics and analysis of phagocytes, and later confirmed by molecular studies. Its management should consider antimicrobial prophylaxis, a search for infections and aggressive management of these. OBJECTIVE: To describe three cases of CGD emphasizing their forms of presentation and to conduct a review of the condition. CASE REPORTS: Three case reports, two of them first cousins, are presented. Molecular diagnosis was reached in one of the cases. Recurrent infections, abscesses, adenitis, granulomas and complications are identified to facilitate the suspected diagnosis of CGD, bearing in mind the importance of early diagnosis and genetic counseling. CONCLUSIONS: EGC is a rare congenital primary immunodeficiency disorder, mostly with X-linked inheritance, autosomal recessive form, and a specific presentation form. Its diagnosis should be timely to avoid complications. Prophylaxis and aggressive treatment of infections should be performed, as well as genetic counseling.",0,1413
429,"Six cases of amoebic encephalitis admitted to the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases between the years 1994-2010 in Peru are reported. These cases were admitted for clinical suspicion of malignant primary brain tumor and one orbital-nasal sarcoma. All cases came from coastal regions; three were less than 24 years of age and four were male. The most common symptoms were headache and seizures. Three cases had more than one brain lesion. Stereotactic biopsy was performed in three patients and the differential pathological diagnosis in two cases was glioma of high and low grade. It was possible to confirm the diagnosis using molecular techniques in paraffin-embedded samples in three cases. All patients died within 15 days of admission to the institution. Amoebic encephalitis may be erroneously interpreted as a cerebral neoplasm, causing delay in the management of the infection.",0,893
430,"An individualised care plan is described for a woman diagnosed with pneumonia, intubated, and on invasive mechanical ventilation, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A nursing care plan was designed based on Marjory Gordon functional patterns. The most important nursing diagnoses were prioritised, using a model of clinical reasoning model (Analysis of the current status) and NANDA taxonomy. A description is presented on, death anxiety, impaired gas exchange, decreased cardiac output, dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility, risk for disuse syndrome, infection risk, and bleeding risk. The principal objectives were: to reduce the fear of the family, achieve optimal respiratory and cardiovascular status, to maintain gastrointestinal function, to avoid immobility complications, and to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding. As regards activities performed: we gave family support; correct management of the mechanical ventilation airway, cardio-respiratory monitoring, skin and nutritional status; control of possible infections and bleeding (management of therapies, care of catheters...). A Likert's scale was used to evaluate the results, accomplishing all key performance indicators which were propose at the beginning. Individualised care plans with NNN taxonomy using the veno-venous ECMO have not been described. Other ECMO care plans have not used the same analysis model. This case can help nurses to take care of patients subjected to veno-venous ECMO treatment, although more cases are needed to standardise nursing care using NANDA taxonomy.",0,1620

435,"The Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis with IgA immune complex deposition. The presentation in adults is rare and severe. Reported cases of HSP in patients infected with HIV are scarce. Neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are commonly found in other systemic vasculitis, but rarely in HSP and even more unusual the perinuclear pattern. Beside small vessel vasculitis, positivity of ANCA can be detected in a number of different pathological conditions in association with infectious processes, including HIV, or cocaine use, and especially the pattern of ANCA-p, associated with drugs, inflammatory bowel or autoimmune diseases. We report the case of a 35 years old man with toxic habits (cocaine, marijuana) who consulted for abdominal pain, hematochezia and purpura on lower extremities, and later fever, joint pain and progression of purpura associated with nephritic syndrome and ANCA-p (+). During hospitalization HIV infection was detected. Renal biopsy showed IgA nephropathy with favorable response to corticosteroid and antiproteinuric treatment. The communication of the case is due to the rarity of the presentation and therapeutic diagnostic challenge. It remains to elucidate the role of ANCA in the pathogenesis and management of adult PSH.",0,1284
436,"The heterotopic pancreas (HP) is a rare condition in the pediatric population. HP cases involving an ileal intussusception are rare in children and very rarely reported, usually presenting with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. We report the case of a one year old male patient with a chronic history of anorexia, irritability, abdominal pain, accompanied by intermittent episodes of ""currant jelly"" stools that evolved to rectal bleeding. The patient presented a concomitant diagnosis of allergic colitis, which prolonged the effective surgical treatment at an external health center. In the abdominal CT scan, the classic ""target"" sign was found. In the exploratory laparotomy an ileoileal intussusception was confirmed, a mass was found that the histopathology laboratory confirmed as HP. To our knowledge, it is the first case of pediatric intussusception by HP reported in Peru.",0,885
437,"Many open questions remain to be elucidated about the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The most intriguing concerns the outcome of MTC patients after surgery. Great importance is usually given to serum calcitonin (Ct) and carcinoembryonic (CEA) levels. It is commonly believed that the higher are the levels of these tumor markers and their kinetics (double time and velocity of markers levels) the worst is the prognosis. However, this is not the rule, as there are huge MTC metastatic deposits characterized by low serum Ct and CEA levels, and this condition is not closely related to the outcome of the disease during post-surgical follow-up. A series is reported here of patients who have these characteristics, as well as a description of their prognosis and clinical outcome.",0,818

Claudin-19 is also expressed in the retinal pigmentary epithelium. The clinical picture causes hypomagnesemia, hyper-calciuria and nephrocalcinosis that can lead to renal failure, which is the condition that marks the prognosis of the disease. Ophthalmologically patients can present macular coloboma, myopic staphyloma and nystagmus.

439,"BACKGROUND: The management of orbitary fractures is one of the most challenging in facial trauma; the variety of reconstruction materials for its treatment is broad and is constantly improving, but despite this there is no consensus for its use or literature that sustains it. OBJECTIVE: To present the use and design of a preformed bone implant as an alternative for the reconstruction of orbital floor fractures in the pediatric age group. CLINICAL CASE: A 7-year old male who suffered a right hemifacial contusion trauma with clinical and tomographic diagnosis of right pure blowout type orbital floor fracture with inferior rectus muscle entrapment and right post-traumatic palpebral ptosis. Successful surgical reconstruction was performed 7 days later with a pre-constructed bone cement implant. Eight weeks after surgery the patient presented with mild residual palpebral ptosis, no ocular movement limitations and no diplopia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a bone cement implant can be considered appropriate for the reconstruction of these fractures, as another alternative to be used by the ophthalmologist among the variety of all the other materials used for this purpose. We consider that our optimism based on the results obtained in this case obligates us to increase the number of patients treated in order to gather more evidence and do larger follow up.",0,1365
440,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a patient referred to us with suspicion of a ciliary body melanoma due to a pigmented lesion in iris root of left eye, associated with high intraocular pressure, despite maximal topical and systemic medication. The systematic workup revealed unilateral changes in the corneal endothelium, compatible with an iridocorneal syndrome. An Ahmed((R)) valve was inserted, achieving sustained control of intraocular pressure and visual field defects. DISCUSSION: Iridocorneal syndromes are a wide and heterogeneous group of diseases, in which endothelial cells grow over the trabeculum, leading to an increase in intraocular pressure. Due to the nature of the disease, tube shunt surgery may be the best option in its treatment. Systematic workup is crucial, since the differential diagnosis may include potentially blinding and even life threatening conditions.",0,892
441,"Acheiropodia is a very rare disease with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by limb reduction defects. It has been described mainly in Brazil. The aim of this report is to describe the first reported cases in Argentina in two affected twins. Patients were reported to the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina (RENAC). Both twins had limb reduction defect including hands, forearms, feet and fibulae. These patients are the first reported cases of acheiropodia syndrome in Argentina. Immigration from Brazil could explain this case in our population.",0,578
442,"CASE REPORT: A 48 year-old woman with visual acuity loss in left eye (0.3). Funduscopic examination showed papillary oedema and neovascular membrane in the left eye. All neurological tests were normal, except the lumbar puncture with opening pressure of 35cmH2O, being diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). After four doses of bevacizumab, the visual acuity of the left eye has not improved and is counting fingers. DISCUSSION: Pathogenesis of the juxtapapillary neovascular membrane associated with IIH is not well known. An effect was observed after the anti-VEGF treatment. In our case, there was no improvement after four doses of intravitreal bevacizumab.",0,681
443,"Umbilical venous catheterization has become a widely accepted intravenous route for premature babies. These catheters allow administration of parenteral nutrition and medication and facilitate blood sampling. Besides these benefits, they also have significant potential complications like portal vein thrombosis, infection, vascular or hepatic injury, arrhythmia and sepsis. One of the rare but important complication is extravasation of the fluids due to misplacement of the catheter. The typical symptoms of this condition are sudden deterioration, hepatic enlargement, hematocrit drop, hypotension and abdominal distension. We herein present a premature newborn with unusual acute abdomen findings suggesting a surgical pathology after the extravasation of total parenteral nutrition into the abdomen.",0,804
444,"Intracranial developmental venous anomalies are the most common vascular malformation. In the immense majority of cases, these anomalies are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, and they are considered benign. Very exceptionally, however, they can cause neurological symptoms. In this article, we present three cases of patients with developmental venous anomalies that presented with different symptoms owing to complications derived from altered venous drainage. These anomalies were located in the left insula, right temporal lobe, and cerebellum. The exceptionality of the cases presented as well as of the images associated, which show the mechanism through which the symptoms developed, lies in the low incidence of symptomatic developmental venous anomalies reported in the literature.",0,797
445,"Central diabetes insipidus is a rare disease of the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis. It is very unusually found in the adult with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is manifested by a polydipsic polyuric syndrome, which must be distinguished from the poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the similarity of both entities and the unusual nature of their coexistence, their suspicion is difficult. The case of a 72-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor insulin control (fasting hyperglycemia greater than 180 mg/dl) who had a long-standing polyuric syndrome is here presented. Hypernatremia and plasma osmolality elevated together with a low urinary osmolality led to the suspicion of diabetes insipidus, which was subsequently confirmed by the dehydration test and the administration of desmopressin sc. With 61% increase in the calculated urinary osmolarity one hour post desmopressin s.c., diabetes insipidus of central type was diagnosed. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance showed a bright spot with normal neurohypophysis, contributing to the diagnosis of the idiopathic form.",0,1094
446,"INTRODUCTION: Glenohumeral dislocation (GHD) is frequent, but traumatic posterior glenohumeral dislocation (TPGHD) is rare, with an incidence of 1-4% of all GHD. The diagnosis is a challenge: sometimes, it can be omitted due to incorrect diagnosis, absence of consideration in the differential diagnosis, suboptimal radiographic evaluation and an absence of characteristic signs and symptoms; missed diagnosis reaches 60-79% and the diagnosis can delay from 24 hours to a year. OBJECTIVE: To transmit previous experiences to provide support for better diagnosing TPGHD, favoring appropriate attention. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. 34-year-old male. Delayed diagnosis of left TPGHD in the 4th week. Reverse Hill-Sachs < 25%. Closed reduction, immobilization for four weeks. Follow-up at week 20, good functional recovery (UCLA = 32). Case 2. 32-year-old male. Eight months with undiagnosed left TPGHD. Reverse Hill-Sachs 25%. Open reduction, immobilization for four weeks. Eight-month post-surgical follow-up. Good functional recovery (UCLA = 29). DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of TPGHD is difficult because of its lack of frequency. Even with delayed diagnosis-treatment, evolution can be favorable provided that the reverse Hill-Sachs injury is 25% or minor. To avoid a delayed diagnosis and inadequate attention, we must always consider the injury mechanism, physical examination with the arm fixed in internal rotation, clinical suspicion in functional deficit for external rotation, flexion and abduction, radiographic studies including true AP and scapula lateral (Y view).",0,1567
447,"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an extremely rare, autosomal recessive, non-acute cutaneous porphyria, caused by uroporphyrinogen III synthase deficiency, codificated by UROS gene on the chromosome 10q26.2. Porphyrins deposit in cornea, bones and teeth. The first symptoms could be manifested in early childhood, with skin fragility, vesicles and bullae. Severe course produces acral tissues mutilation, eye involvement, hemolytic anemia and hypersplenism. The treatment is complex and it is based in the photoprotection. A correct diagnosis can significantly improve the quality and life expectancy of these patients. We present the case of a child with congenital erythropoietic porphyria confirmed by genetic analysis.",0,728
448,"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of simple renal cysts is very high, especially in elderly people. However, malignant transformation of a simple renal cyst is exceptional. Likewise, the treatment to be carried out, in these rare cases, is controversial, with respect to opting for radical renal surgery. METHODS: We present the case of a patient with a solid nodule in a large cyst. Complete removal of the cyst was performed by transperitoneal laparoscopic technique. The histopathological study of the surgical piece revealed the existence of a cyst with clear renal cell carcinoma with nucleolar grade 2. The clinical evolution has been satisfactory, performing a minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic cyst excision). DISCUSSION: Although it is considered that surgical treatment of choice is radical surgery in these cases, we believe that nephron sparing surgery may represent a therapeutic option, taking into account the young age of our patient. A histogenetic hypothesis is discussed to explain the appearance of a clear cell tumor in a simple renal cyst. CONCLUSION: The development of a renal cell carcinoma in simple renal cysts is a very infrequent pathology.Laparoscopic total cystectomy is a minimally invasive therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma originating in a simple renal cyst, although it is of an important size. We establish the hypothesis of migration of the cells of the renal collecting tubes into the cyst wall to explain the malignant transformation of the renal simple cyst.",0,1523
449,"BACKGROUND: Placenta percreta may lead to massive obstetric haemorrhage, haemodynamic decompensation, and ultimately death. Total obstetric hysterectomy is universally accepted as treatment; however, the emergence of new techniques such as the uterine artery angioembolisation approach, and the use of chemotherapy agents such as methotrexate, are alternatives also described in the literature. CLINICAL CASE: A 28 year-old patient, in her fourth gestation, with a previous history of 2 vaginal and 1 caesarean birth 4, in her 28.4 week of pregnancy, by second trimester ultrasound, was diagnosed with placenta percreta with bladder and rectal invasion using magnetic resonance imaging. Multidisciplinary and sequential treatment included: Caesarean with placenta in situ, uterine artery embolisation immediately after caesarean, chemotherapy with methotrexate weekly for 4 doses, and finally obstetric hysterectomy after bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The outcome was favourable and the patient was discharged in good general condition. CONCLUSIONS: The protocoled and sequential management including selective embolization immediately after caesarean section with placenta in situ, weekly chemotherapy with methotrexate and obstetric hysterectomy, preceded by bilateral ligation of the hypogastric arteries, is a therapeutic alternative to be considered in cases of placenta percreta.",0,1394
450,"Subtrochanteric fractures in children are rare events that occur in only 4% of all femur fractures; most injuries occur as a result of high-energy trauma, being young male patients the most affected. The management of this type of injury is controversial; there are many forms of treatment, including the use of plaster spica 90-90, closed reduction and use of elastic or rigid intramedullary nails, open reduction and plate placement, and the use of external fixators. Most suggest that for children under 10 a nonoperative approach should be preferred and that older ones should be managed surgically, but it is between six and 12-year-olds that most of the controversy exists. In this article, we present the management of this entity with a proximal fracture plate using a minimally invasive technique.",0,806
451,"BACKGROUND: Marjolin's ulcer is defined as the appearance of a neoplasm within a chronic wound. The most common histological type is squamous. A total of 2 cases treated in our hospital are presented. CLINICAL CASE: Case 1. A 71 year old man who presented with redness and suppuration from the wounds he had in his right foot after an electric shock 40 years earlier. The radiology showed involvement of the 4 degrees and 5 degrees metatarsal. Supracondylar amputation was performed, showing a well-differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma. CASE 2: A 56 year old male, paraplegic for 20 years. He was treated due to an infected right heel ulcer, with partial improvement, but the ulcers persisted. Biopsy was performed, reporting as epidermoid carcinoma. Infracondylar amputation was performed. The diagnosis was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the dermis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Marjolin's ulcer is 1.3-2.2% of all ulcers. Diagnosis is difficult, so biopsy is recommended on any suspicious lesion or ulcer that has received conservative treatment for one month without improvement, although this time limit is not clear. The treatment is the surgery. Local excision with a margin of an inch is enough. If the ulcer is extensive, amputation is required. Survival is estimated between 66 and 80% at 2 years, with recurrence rates of 23%. Unfavourable factors are poor tumour differentiation and metastasis, appearing in 20% of cases.",0,1473
452,"BACKGROUND: The development of pancreatic metastases in renal carcinoma is very uncommon. The aim of the paper is to present a clinical case of this disease and review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. CLINICAL CASE: A case is presented of a 72-year-old female, with a history of renal carcinoma in the right kidney treated by total nephrectomy. At follow-up, in a radiological control, a suspicious metastatic pancreatic lesion was detected. A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed, and histopathology confirmed the origin as metastatic renal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic metastases from renal cancer are very rare, and are usually diagnosed in the monitoring the primary cancer (because most of them are asymptomatic). The treatment for isolated resectable pancreatic metastases without extra-pancreatic extension is surgical resection.",0,875
453,"Forestier Disease, or Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH), causes a considerable ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. When it involves cervical segments, it can be accompanied by dysphagia, dysphonia and/or dyspnea. This entity usually has a benign course. Surgical treatment is required for progressive cases. We report a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic cervical pain and slight neck stiffness. On the imaging studies, there was an exuberant ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, at the cervical spine level, between C2 and C7. He was managed conservatively without clinical deterioration in a six-year follow-up.",0,679
454,"Cystic lesions of the posterior triangle are a pathologic entity whose diagnosis is made in the first two years of life. Its presentation in adulthood is an incidental finding and the differential diagnosis includes cystic lymphangioma, lymphatic metastasis of thyroid cancer and branchial cyst. Often with the finding of a cervical lump, FNA is made before diagnostic imaging is performed, however, this procedure is not always advisable. We reviewed the cases of patients who came last year to our department with a cystic mass in this location and correlating the imaging findings with pathologic specimen. We show characteristic findings of these lesions in order to make an early diagnosis and thus to get the approach and treatment appropriate of adult patients with a cystic lesion in the posterior cervical triangle.",0,824
455,"We report the case of a 32-year-old male diagnosed with TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, presenting with tuberous sclerosis (TS) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease simultaneously. He progressed to end-stage renal disease and received a kidney transplant at the age of 12. The native kidneys presented angiomyolipomas (AML), which are common benign tumours in patients with TS. Seventeen years after transplantation, he presented with abdominal pain, anaemia and a retroperitoneal haematoma, the latter caused by renal AML bleeding. Selective embolisation was performed. Our patient could have benefited from the administration of mTOR inhibitors at transplant. This therapy is immunosuppressive and reduces the size of benign tumours in TS as well as the risk of rupture and bleeding. This patient did not receive mTOR inhibitors at the time of the transplant because the relationship between mTOR inhibitors and TS was unknown at that time. This case confirms the persistent risk of renal AML bleeding for both transplanted patients and patients on dialysis. As a result, we would recommend routine check-ups of native kidneys and nephrectomy assessment.",0,1172
456,"Dengue virus infection constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. It is caused by a virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It produces a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection to severe forms of the disease with hemorrhagic fever or shock secondary to capillary leak syndrome. Four serotypes have been described; serotype 2 and serotype 3 are associated with the most severe forms of the disease. The diagnosis is based on laboratory tests aimed to detect antibodies, viral RNA, or antigens in serum. The hemophagocytic syndrome is generated by a dysfunction of the immune system with clinical, hematological, biochemical and histological manifestations. The association between these two entities is described as an unusual and severe presentation of dengue fever. We present a case of an adult patient with this association and very high blood levels of ferritin, who responded favorably to supportive care.",0,951
457,"We report a 19 years old male presenting with knee pain, elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria. Further investigation found positive antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies and a liver biopsy revealed the presence of an autoimmune hepatitis. Treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine was started, resulting in normalization of liver enzymes but proteinuria persisted and a kidney biopsy disclosed a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The use of lisinopril resulted in a significative reduction of proteinuria and, after 30 months of follow up, he continues with azathioprine, lisinopril and a low prednisone dose without evidence of liver or kidney disease activity.",0,680
458,"CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old paraplegic male diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and complete spinal cord compression arrived at our clinic because of fever and purple discoloration of the urine. We diagnosed purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) and treated him with oral ciprofloxacin and urinary catheter replacement. DISCUSSION: PUBS is an unusual phenomenon that occurs predominantly in bedridden patients with long-term urinary catheters, presenting as a purple discoloration of the urine bag. Its pathogenesis involves the metabolism of indoxyl sulfate by sulfatase-producing bacteria. Knowledge of this entity is important in order to avoid unnecessary diagnostic workup and treatment.",0,688
459,"BACKGROUND: The bilateral brachial plexus block is considered a contraindication, due to the possible development of complications, such as: toxicity from local anaesthetics or bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. However, with the real time visualisation provided by the ultrasound scan, these complications have decreased and it is a safer procedure. CLINICAL CASES: Four cases are presented where the bilateral block was performed using guided ultrasound, as the patients were unable to receive general anaesthesia due to a history of adverse effects or the use of opioids in the post-operative or by the prediction of a difficult airway associated with obesity. A systematic review of the literature from January 1993 to June 2013, was also performed by using a search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, ARTEMISA, LILACS, Google data bases, in Spanish and English language with the following words: bilateral brachial plexus block, bilateral interscalene block, bilateral infraclavicular block, bilateral supraclavicular block, bilateral lateral supraclavicular block, bilateral axillary block, ultrasound-guided bilateral brachial plexus block. CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence found, ultrasound-guided bilateral brachial plexus block in selected patients and expert hands, is no longer a contraindication.",0,1299
460,"BACKGROUND: Over time, the prone position has been shown to be effective and safe for performing percutaneous nephrolithotomy. One of its disadvantages, however, is the inability to simultaneously perform an ureteroscopy after positioning the patient, which is feasible in the supine position. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing flexible ureteroscopy with the patient in the prone position. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a case of percutaneous nephrolithotomy of partial staghorn calculi in the prone position during which access to the middle calyx was not possible. It was therefore necessary to conduct flexible ureteroscopy. The 64-year-old female patient had consulted for lumbar pain of 6 months of evolution. RESULTS: We performed percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the prone position. After extracting calculi from the inner calyx and renal pelvis, access to the fragments located in the middle calyx could not be achieved. Rather than performing a new puncture, we decided to enter in a retrograde manner with a flexible ureteroscope, succeeding in extracting the residual calculi, leaving the patient completely free of calculi. CONCLUSION: In our case, the implementation of retrograde flexible ureteroscopy was feasible without changing the patient's original position.",0,1310
461,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are susceptible to severe infections such as leishmaniasis. As L. infantum is endemic in the Mediterranean region, it is necessary to rule this infectious process out in any RA patient presenting with fever and pancytopenia. An early diagnosis based on a high suspicion can prevent a fatal outcome.",0,389
462,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which affects the motor neurons and produces a progressive muscle weakness, leading to atrophy and muscle paralysis, and ultimately death. Performing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with sedation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can be a challenge for the anesthesiologist. The case is presented of a 76-year-old patient who suffered from advanced stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ASA III, in which a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed with deep sedation, for which non-invasive ventilation was used as a respiratory support to prevent hypoventilation and postoperative respiratory complications.",0,734
463,"Obstetric haemorrhage can endanger the lives of mother and foetus. It often occurs unexpectedly without clear predictors. A high degree of suspicion helps to avoid delaying resuscitation measures. We present the case of a ruptured ovarian metastasis that occurred during labour. It caused a massive bleed forcing a caesarean section due to non-reassuring foetal status. This was an unprecedented and undescribed onset of Krukenberg tumour formation. Malignant tumours in pregnancy are rare and difficult to diagnose due to their clinical manifestations which often overlap with those of pregnancy itself (dyspepsia, nausea and bloating). Despite the available therapeutic measures, a delay in diagnosis is a determining factor for long-term prognosis. We review the causes of obstetric bleeding, and underline how rare Krukenberg tumours concomitant to pregnancy are.",0,867
464,"Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses are rare but associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of these infections, mainly due to a greater availability of computed tomography scan and a greater virulence of the germs (Group A b-hemolytic Streptococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). They predominate in children younger than 5 years. Treatment of retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses consists of an intravenous antibiotic and eventually surgical drainage. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients with abscesses greater than 2 cm (3), with respiratory difficulty or poor response to initial antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study is to describe clinical features and treatment of three cases of deep neck abscesses presented at Hospital de Ninos Pedro de Elizalde, Otorhinolaryngology Department in the period of one year.",0,945
465,"Acute pericarditis is the most common disease of the pericardium encountered in clinical practice. It is diagnosed in 0.1% of all admissions and 5% of emergency room admissions for chest pain. In developed countries, it is usually due to a benign cause. Idiopathic and infectious pericarditis are more common than secondary to surgical pericardiotomy or neoplastic causes, whereas tuberculosis is the dominant cause in developing countries. The most common symptoms of pericarditis are characteristic chest pain and fever. Since pericarditis presents a benign outcome because of self-limiting and good response to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, it can be safely managed on outpatient basis unless a specific cause is suspected or the patient has high-risk features to avoid complications such as pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade or recurrent pericarditis. We report a case of pericarditis, diagnosed 9 months after surgical closure of an atrial septal defect, in a 7-year-old boy with favorable evolution.",0,1021
466,"Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a technique used in interventional radiology for the diagnosis of vascular cerebral conditions. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a complication of endovascular procedures that involve atherosclerotic plaque removal with subsequent embolisation. The case is presented on a patient who noticed a sudden vision loss during a DSA. Funduscopy showed retinal pallor and a cherry red spot. The angiography showed a structure suggesting the presence of an embolus in the central retinal artery. The patient was diagnosed with a CRAO, and unsuccessfully treated with ocular massage, topical hypotensive drugs, oral acetazolamide, and anterior chamber paracentesis, with a final visual acuity of 0.05. Central retinal artery occlusion is a rare complication, but due to its poor prognosis, it must be considered when performing neuroradiological procedures such as DSA.",0,910
467,"Intracranial arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled cavities that arise within the cranial arachnoid, representing approximately 1%-2% of all intracranial lesions among the paediatric population. We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who presented with instability and episodes of ocular deviation. A computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a suprasellar cyst and obstructive hydrocephalus. At birth a transfontanellar ultrasound was normal. The cyst underwent endoscopic fenestration with complete remission of symptoms. In the review of the literature, we found only 6 previous cases of an intracranial arachnoid cyst whose origin was not clearly congenital or traumatic, and ours is the second case of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst to arise de novo. The clinical features, imaging characteristics and treatment of the previously reported cases are discussed.",0,910
468,"BACKGROUND: Actinomyces infection is a chronic inflammatory process that can sometimes, clinically and radiographically, closely mimic a malignant tumour, which may lead to giving a delayed or inappropriate treatment. CLINICAL CASE: Male 41 years old, with no previous history, with abdominal pain of one month onset, as well as weight loss, intermittent fever and diarrhoea. He developed acute abdomen and underwent surgery, finding a tumour in the distal ileum with necrosis and punctiform perforations. A resection was performed on the affected part of the ileum and colon, as well as an ileostomy using Hartmann's procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomycosis is a disease that must be considered by the surgeon when faced with a clinical picture of subacute onset with intermittent fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, and even anaemia in patients with abdominal and retroperitoneal abscesses or previous history of surgery.",0,920
469,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is widely distributed in hospital environments, causing serious infections, mainly the bloodstream, surgical site infection and pneumonia. Vancomycin (VAN) is the antibiotic of choice for treating severe MRSA infections; however, nowadays worldwide resistant strains (VRSA), with intermediate susceptibility (VISA) and decreased susceptibility or hetero-resistance to VAN (hVISA) have been reported, related to treatment failure and increased mortality.

470,"INTRODUCTION: Sociosanitary improvements experienced in western society have significantly increased the survival of patients with opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS). However, several studies have reported neurological, cognitive-behavioral and development persistent deficits in 70-80% of these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed cases of neuroblastic tumors diagnosed in a total period of 13 years and six months (from January 2000 to May 2013) and its association with OMAS in the pediatric service of a general hospital of a third level. Furthermore, it conducts a full neuropsychological study in three children diagnosed with OMAS. RESULTS: We objectified deficits in intelligence, attention, processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills, fine motor skills and executive functions. In addition, we found alterations in the psychological profile. CONCLUSIONS: Data emphasize the role of the cerebellum in complex cognitive processing in child population probably linked to neurodevelopmental deficits in this structure caused by deficiencies of the immune system. The results are interpreted in the framework of child neuropsychology and their interest in studying the brain-behavior relationships in the dynamic context of brain development.",0,1298

She was diagnosed with spasm of the near reflex. Treatment with injections of botulinum toxin in both medial rectus has temporally resolved the convergence spasm. DISCUSSION: Near reflex spasm is characterized as miosis, pseudomyopia, and convergent strabismus that lead to diplopia, blurred vision, headache, and variable, progressive, and intermittent esotropia. As the spasm worsens there will be limited ocular versions and ductions simulating a sixth nerve palsy. Botulinum toxin may be effective in some cases.",0,699

476,"INTRODUCTION: Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is a rare entity in the pediatric age. It is de fined by the infiltration of the renal parenchyma by mononuclear and/or polynuclear cells with se condary involvement of the tubules, without glomerular injury. It can be triggered by infections or immunological diseases, drugs like NSAIDs or be of idiopathic origin. OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness among pediatricians about the prescription of NSAIDs, especially to patients of less than a year old, since they can provoke renal damage. CASE REPORT: A ten month old child, with no nephrological an tecedents of interest, was transferred to our hospital due to acute renal failure stage 3 KDIGO 2012. The three previous days received treatment with amoxicillin and ibuprofen for acute otitis media. Physical examination revealed mild eyelid edema with normal blood pressure. In the urine analysis, there were non-nephrotic proteinuria with tubular component, microhematuria and leukocyturia. Renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. ATIN was suspected and so the antibiotic was changed to intravenous cefotaxime and ibuprofen was discontinued, opting for conservative management of acute renal damage. There was an increase in the number of creatinine up to 4.14 mg/dL and eosinophilia, with the immunological study being negative. Treatment with methylprednisolone was initiated, achieving normalization of renal function. DISCUSSION: NTIA can be produced by any me dication through an idiosyncratic immune reaction. Among the responsible drugs, there are ones commonly used in the pediatric age, such as NSAIDs. Therefore, the pediatricians should pay special attention during prescriptions and have a high diagnostic suspicion of this disease.",0,1750
477,"BACKGROUND: Duodenal carcinoma is very rare. It represents 33-45% of the all tumours of the small bowel. The symptoms are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often accidental. CLINICAL CASE: A 35-year old man was admitted to our hospital with post-prandial abdominal pain. Upper gastrointestinal examination revealed a tumour of the third duodenal portion, which was diagnosed, using endoscopic biopsy, as a tubular adenoma with high grade dysplasia. The computed axial tomography scan, the magnetic resonance imaging, and the endoscopic ultrasound showed the neoplasia of the third duodenal portion with no lymph node or peritoneal metastases. Partial resection of the duodenum was performed. The definitive histopathological diagnosis was primary adenocarcinoma of the third duodenal portion. pT2 N0M0, originated in a tubular adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: Primitive neoplasia of the duodenum is very rare. Duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy is recommended in proximally located tumours, while segmental resection of the duodenum is appropriate for distal locations, with the same survival.",0,1079
478,"The Bosworth fracture is a pattern of fracture-dislocation of the ankle joint with fixed dislocation of the proximal part of the fibula behind the posterior malleolus. It is a rare injury, which requires high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Fixed dislocation of the fibula does not allow for closed reduction, so open reduction and fixation of fibula or tibia is required. We present a case report of a patient who suffered a Bosworth fracture, with associated medial malleolus fracture. She underwent surgical treatment with open reduction and internal fixation of the fibula and tibia. We also performed anterior arthroscopy of the ankle, to evaluate the tibiofibular syndesmosis, remove loose osteochondral fragments, and perform debridement and microfracture of unstable chondral lesions of the talus. One year after injury, she remains with occasional pain and a normal range of motion comparing to the contralateral ankle joint. Bosworth fracture is a serious and rare injury, which requires early diagnosis and urgent surgical treatment. Performing ankle arthroscopy in the acute treatment of the Bosworth fracture allows for diagnosis and treatment of associated intra-articular injuries, as well as assisting with adequate fracture reduction and evaluation of the tibiofibular syndesmosis stability.",0,1310
479,"CLINICAL CASE: A 43-year-old man was treated for reduced visual acuity, initially attributed to strabismic amblyopia. On fundus examination, bilateral neurosensory detachments (NSD) were observed in posterior pole, surrounded by deposits of lipofuscin. His 3-year-old son was also examined and circumscribed NSD was observed with the presence of pseudohypopyon in OD and a fibrosis scar in OS. The Arden ratio were decreased in electrooculography (EOG) in both patients, and genetic studies revealed a single mutation of the BEST1 gene. DISCUSSION: The existence of extensive bilateral NSD may be an unusual form of presentation of Best disease. Family history, EOG, and genetic study supported this diagnosis.",0,710
480,"CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman diagnosed with Zika virus infection 6 months before she arrived at this hospital. She referred to a progressive and painless vision loss, of 2 weeks onset after the infection diagnosis. She was treated with topical steroids. Previous visual acuity was recovered, but she still refers to reduced visual field and nyctalopia. Ophthalmologic examination revealed severe retinal sequels, compatible with autoimmune retinopathy. Based on the clinical features and the temporal relationship with Zika virus infection, non-para-neoplastic autoimmune retinopathy was diagnosed and managed with steroids and infliximab. DISCUSSION: Zika virus can trigger a non-para-neoplastic autoimmune retinopathy. The diagnosis is based on clinical features, and requires early immunosuppressive therapy.",0,815
481,"Plerocercoidosis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by plerocercoid larvae of the genus Spirometra. The larvae migrate through the intestinal wall tissue, by subcutaneous route and can reach different areas of the body like the head, the brain and the eye socket. A case is reported of a 45 year-old man from the Peruvian Amazon with burning sensation associated with conjunctival edema and hemorrhage in the outer eye border of the right eye for eleven months. A localized worm in the right orbital cavity was observed, which was extracted. Morphological and histopathological studies identified it as Spirometra mansonoides localized in the eye, which is the first case reported in Peru.",0,685
482,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral air embolism following endoscopic processes is an infrequent complication, but can have catastrophic consequences. CASE REPORT: An 85-year-old male diagnosed with distal cholangiocarcinoma with criteria for unresectability who was submitted to placement of a biliary drainage prosthesis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed to change the prosthesis. After the procedure, the patient's vital signs and level of consciousness underwent a decline, and orotracheal intubation was required. A computerised axial tomography scan of the head showed evidence of a massive air embolism with focal points of hyperacute ischaemia in both hemispheres. The patient later died. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral air embolism following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is infrequent, but potentially lethal. Manipulation of the bilio-intestinal wall in endoscopic examinations could give rise to communications between the lumen and the venous system. This, together with the high insufflation pressure used to conduct this test, would condition the passage of air to the portal venous system, and from there to the circulatory system. In the central nervous system, air bubbles would lead to a vascular obstruction, with the subsequent ischaemia and necrosis of tissues. An early diagnosis and life support therapy are essential. Its timely management can contribute to a better prognosis which, at least initially, is gloomy.",0,1462
483,"The bronze baby syndrome is an infrequent dyschromia resulting from phototherapy in newborn babies with neonatal jaundice. Even though the common phenotype has been described in patients with direct neonatal hyperbilirubinemia secondary to cholestasis, several cases of patients with indirect neonatal hyperbilirubinemia who have managed to reverse it have been reported, as well as patients with isolated hyperbilirubinemia.Currently, the physiopathology of this condition is still a subject of controversy and, therefore, there is a lack of clear conducts for its correct diagnosis and treatment.Generally, this syndrome has been considered as a mild condition that is resolved with the suspension of phototherapy. Its duration is usually not greater than the neonatal period, and it has no long-term sequelae. However, its occurrence is considered an absolute contraindication for the continuation of phototherapy. In case of persistence, the recommendation is to decrease bilirrubin levels and proceed with exchange transfusion; this procedure, however, represents risks for the newborn, so our recommendation is to suspend phototherapy and reinitiate it if the direct bilirrubin value decreases, andcholestasis compromise has been discarded. Serial evaluations of acute encephalopathy caused by bilirrubin are absolutely recommended.The objective of this paper was to describe the case of a newborn with ABO incompatibility who developed the bronze baby syndrome. This patient responded satisfactorily to the suspension and resumption of phototherapy without exchange transfusion.",0,1585
484,"Shigella spp. is the most frequent micro-biological isolation in bacterial diarrhea in Argentina. It causes a watery diarrhea or dysenteric disease. It rarely causes extraintestinal problems. It has an incidence of bacteremia of 0,4-7,3%, and its appearance compels us to look for associated risk factors, as children under one year of age and immunodeficiency, among others. We describe two children with Shigella flexneri bacteremia. They presented with fever and diarrhea. One of them had primary immune deficiency.",0,518
485,"Clavicle fractures correspond to 35% of traumatic fractures of the shoulder girdle. Regional anaesthesia has shown better analgesic results than systemic treatment for perioperative management. Innervation of the clavicle is complex, at present its knowledge raises controversy. The lateral pectoral nerve through the innervating musculature predominantly participates in the lateral and anterior part of the clavicle. The following report of 7 cases describes the effective postoperative analgesia of modified PEC II block in patients with middle third clavicle fracture or acromioclavicular dislocation who underwent a modified PEC II block for postoperative pain management, in the context of a multimodal analgesia. The potential advantage of this management over other analgesic procedures should be evaluated in specific clinical trials.",0,843
486,"The fast and increasing advance in surgical technology during the last decades has led to a remarkable development in laparoscopic surgery. ""Minimally invasive"" surgery has become very popular in the last few years, not only in gynecological procedures but also in general surgery, orthopedics, thoracic and urological procedures. Gas inflation into the abdominal cavity and patient position provokes physiological changes, as well as complications that are not seen in open surgery. Pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position beyond 35 degrees cause hemodynamic changes, resulting in an increase in arterial and central venous pressure. The external auditory canal vessels are directly affected by these changes, and postoperative otorrhagia after a prolonged laparoscopic surgery may be present. A case is presented of postoperative bilateral otorrhagia after laparoscopic left hemicolectomy.",0,899
487,"We describe the case of a young woman who was diagnosed with advanced kidney disease, with an incidental finding of nephrocalcinosis of unknown aetiology, having been found asymptomatic throughout her life. The genetic study by panels of known genes associated with tubulointerstitial disease allowed us to discover autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis associated with a de novo mutation in exon 14 of the SLC4A1 gene, which would have been impossible to diagnose clinically due to the advanced nature of the kidney disease when it was discovered.",0,559
488,"Tetralogy of fallot (TOF) is one of the most common congenital heart disease (CHD) in children. With the development of pediatric surgery and intensive care units, increasing number of grown-up CHD patients are presenting for non-cardiac surgeries. Non-operated TOF patients suffer from chronic hypoxia and decreased pulmonary blood flow resulting in considerable alteration in the physiology. The optimal management of these patients, therefore, require a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of the uncorrected TOF. We hereby report a case of successful management of a 10-year-old child with an uncorrected TOF posted for tibial external fixation device.",0,666
489,"Fabry disease is an inherited, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme alpha galactosidase A (alpha-GLA A), which leads to glycosphingolipid accumulation, mainly globotriaosylceramide, in tissues. Disease prevalence and the index of suspicion are both low, which tends to result in delayed diagnosis and treatment. We present the case of a male Fabry disease patient who manifested no angiokeratoma lesions but presented multiple parapelvic cysts and renal failure. The genetic study revealed an alpha-GLA A gene mutation that had not been recorded in the mutations registry. The de novo mutation was not found in his relatives and it was not transmitted to his offspring. The large number and peculiar appearance of the parapelvic cysts led to the diagnosis.",0,790
490,"Chromoblastomycosis is a neglected and chronic fungal disease, mainly affects the subcutaneous tissue in limbs of people with occupational risk. Here, we report two cases of adult patients from tropical regions of northern Peru, affected with chronic erythematous scaly lesions and multiple blackheads, pain, itching and scarring in older areas of injury. Direct examination of the dermal scales showed typical of this disease fumagoides cells; Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Fonsecaea sp. were isolated for at first and second case respectively. Patients received antifungal treatment with itraconazole; however, in both cases the final outcome was not observed due to treatment abandonment and medical care.",0,701
491,"The antiphospholipid syndrome is a multisystem autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies against a variety of phospholipids and phospholipid binding proteins are produced. It occurs in 1.8% of the population and only 2% of the cases are pediatric. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is wide from asymptomatic patients to a life-threatening disease like the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. Any organ can be affected. The most frequent manifestations in pediatrics correspond to venous thrombosis in 60% of patients, arterial thrombosis in 32%, hematological disease in 38% (thrombocytopenia, leucopenia), skin alterations in 18% (livedo reticularis, Raynaud's phenomenon) and neurological signs in 16%. We describe the case of a previously healthy 14-year-old female patient diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome.",0,829
492,"The krokodil use disorder is an addictive pathology with quite severe organic effects, especially at the skin level, that causes severe and degenerative necrosis of blood and muscle tissue. Though this disorder has a low prevalence in Spain, compared to the large number of consumers in other countries such as Ukraine or Russia, its consumption is slowly but gradually expanding in countries of the European Union and America. The simplicity of the process of obtaining the substance from desomorphine, together with its high availability and low cost, contribute toward consumers' self-sufficiency. This article presents the case of a user of krokodil and reviews the clinical symptoms of oral ingestion.",0,706
493,"Osteoarticular infection in children frequently occurs before 10 years of age. Surgical drainage is sometimes required, whereas acute osteomyelitis can be treated with antibiotic therapy alone. The duration of antibiotic therapy varies, 2 weeks is sufficient for septic arthritis, whereas 6 weeks is often required for complicated cases. Some of these antibiotic drugs present direct complications with low clinical impact in certain individuals. Hypersensitivity to these drugs causes different reactions in children. DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) is a severe and potentially life-threatening drug reaction. It is characterised by high fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and skin rash. From a clinical perspective, these symptoms can lead to an exacerbation of the initial infectious process for which treatment was commenced. The liver is the organ most often affected in DRESS syndrome associated with haematological changes, potentially similar to sepsis. We present two cases of children with osteoarticular infections who developed DRESS syndrome after antibiotic therapy. Both patients made a complete recovery after cessation of the antibiotic drugs used.",0,1201
494,"Hereditary renal amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant condition with considerable overlap with other amyloidosis types. Differential diagnosis is complicated, but is relevant for prognosis and treatment. We describe a patient with nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure, who had a mother with renal amiloidosis. Renal biopsy revealed amyloid deposits in glomerular space, with absence of light chains and protein AA. We suspected amyloidosis with fibrinogen A alpha chain deposits, which is the most frequent cause of hereditary amyloidosis in Europe, with a glomerular preferential affectation. However, the genetic study showed a novel mutation in apolipoprotein AI. On reviewing the biopsy of the patient's mother similar glomerular deposits were found, but there were significant deposits in the renal medulla as well, which is typical in APO AI amyloidosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Apo AI amyloidosis is characterized by slowly progressive renal disease and end-stage renal disease occurs aproximately 3 to 15 years from initial diagnosis. Renal transplantation offers an acceptable graft survival and in these patients with hepatorenal involvement simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation could be considered.",0,1259
495,"We present the case of a 31 year-old male patient, who presented polyneuropathy, symmetrical, ascending, and progressive, that led to prostration of eight months duration, accompanied by hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and the presence of multiple erythematous nodules on the skin. The MRI showed hypointense lesions in the vertebrae T-6 and L-4 with sclerotic appearance. The bone marrow biopsy reported the presence of 12% plasma cells with A. restriction, supporting monoclonal gammopathy (plasmocytoma).",0,525
496,"UNLABELLED: Overlap of systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis is a rare condition, occasionally described. Both autoimmune diseases can share common autoimmune features such as polyartralgia, hypergammaglobulinemia and positive antinuclear antibody, but they have been considered as two different entities. We report a 14 year old female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who developed autoimmune hepatitis two years later. She had jaundice with no history of viral infections, drug intake, alcohol abuses or exposition to blood products. She was positive for antinuclear antibody, double stranded DNA antibody and LKM 1 antibody. Histological examination of the liver showed interface hepatitis with lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration. The patient satisfied the international criteria for both systemic lupus erythematosus and Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings improved under treatment with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSION: Autoimmune hepatitis may occur during the course of systemic lupus erythematosus and an early diagnosis is important for preventing advanced liver disease. Definitive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis requires confirmation by means of a liver biopsy.",0,1251
497,"BACKGROUND: The current imbalance between donor supply and patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) is significant. To resolve this situation, marginal organs, such as those from type 2 donation after cardiac death (DCD2), are being considered. METHODS: In the present article, we present the first LT with a new protocol consisting in normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for a type 2 DCD graft initially rejected for LT. RESULTS: After a favorable evolution with NMP (improved macroscopic appearance of the graft, acid-base equilibrium control and bile production), the transplantation was performed without major incidents. The evolution of the graft and patient were favorable. After 3 months, cholangiography showed no signs of ischemic cholangiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Three-month patient and graft survival are encouraging, but more cases are needed to test the clinical efficacy of the new protocol.",0,964
498,"Infections among health-care workers (HCWs) have been a common feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) since its emergence. The majority of these infections have occurred in locations where infection-control precautions either had not been instituted or had been instituted but were not followed. Recommended infection-control precautions include the use of negative-pressure isolation rooms where available; N95 or higher level of respiratory protection; gloves, gowns, and eye protection; and careful hand hygiene. This report summarizes a cluster of SARS cases among HCWs in a hospital that occurred despite apparent compliance with recommended infection-control precautions.",1,690

502,"BACKGROUND: The hydatid disease, or echinococcosis, is endemic in Mediterranean countries, as well as in Australia, Asia, Africa, South America, and Canada. Among its complications is intraperitoneal rupture, a rare form of presentation, with highly variable symptoms. The treatment of choice is surgery plus adjuvant medical treatment in most patients. OBJECTIVE: A case is presented of a patient with disseminated peritoneal hydatidosis manifested as intestinal ischaemia. CLINICAL CASE: A 50-year-old male was admitted to the emergency room with a history of chronic abdominal pain that worsened in the last 24hours. He showed signs of sepsis in the physical examination and was subjected to surgery, in which intestinal ischaemia was found due to a disseminated peritoneal cystic disease, which had led to mesentery retraction. An intestinal resection with an end-ileostomy was performed. The results of the biopsy of the cystic lesions was disseminated peritoneal echinococcosis. Medical treatment was started with albendazole and praziquantel. CONCLUSION: This case shows a rare presentation of disseminated peritoneal hydatidosis, which led to intestinal ischaemia.",0,1172

504,"A 66 year-old patient, monitored for diabetic retinopathy refractory to multiple treatment methods despite a good metabolic control, referred to progressive weight loss. For this reason, a systemic study was performed, detecting anaemia, elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hyperproteinaemia due to elevated serum levels of monoclonal IgM. Subsequently, by performing a bone marrow biopsy and genetic study, the diagnosis of Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia was made. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia is a low frequency lymphoproliferative disease, for which the main manifestation is a hyperviscosity syndrome that can produce ophthalmological signs detectable by funduscopy and imaging tests. A multimodal study is useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal involvement. The incorporation of angiography by optical coherence tomography allows a more precise study of the microvascular disorders that may occur at the posterior pole level.",0,962

508,"CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with epiphora, ocular pain, and foreign body sensation in both eyes for one month. Examination revealed bilateral peripheral corneal ulcers. The patient had been treated with immunomodulators, and she was treated in the left eye with peripheral semi-circular keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty, conjunctival-corneal-scleroplasty, buccal mucosal graft, tibial osteo-keratoprosthesis and finally, retinal detachment. DISCUSSION: Mooren's ulcer is an immunological corneal disease. This lesion must be treated initially with immunomodulators. Surgical treatment should be considered when a risk of corneal perforation is present, when the perforation appears, or under acute necrosis.",0,739
509,"Lung isolation using one-lung ventilation is common during thoracic surgery procedures, as it allows proper visualisation and manipulation of the lung to be operated on. Selective lobar blockade has been described in patients that do not tolerate one-lung ventilation, and is usually achieved using endobronchial blockers. However, it depends on endobronchial blocker availability, its complexity regarding proper positioning, and the need for constant monitoring to ensure the correct placement of the bronchial seal. In the clinical case to be described, a new method was used to increase the available surface for oxygen exchange. This was accomplished by means of direct supply of oxygen through the bronchoscope's working channel to one of the not-to-be operated-on, non-ventilated lung lobes. With this technique, the surgeon had an optimal operating field, oxygenation from one-lung ventilation improved and no perioperative complications were found.",0,957

511,"OBJECTIVE: Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the prostate is very a rare tumor. It is comprised of cells that are similar to signet ring cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis requires histopathology and also elimination of the adenocarcinomas of other organs. To our knowledge 157 cases have been reported in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively searched in tumor registries from Hospital Aleman de Buenos Aires to identify all prostate cancer since 1990. We analyzed the following variables: age at diagnosis, median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, stage, global survival, among others. A review of the literature was done and compared with this series of cases. RESULTS: We identified 5 cases. In our series we found: Mean age 77.8 years (SD 3.2), Median PSA level 18 ng/ml (Range 10.6-331 ng/ml), 3/5 (60%) localized disease and 2/5 (40%) with distant disease at diagnosis. Median survival of 23 months. Comparing with other series we found patients of older age and lower median survival. CONCLUSION: Primary Signet ring cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare and aggressive histological variant of adenocarcinomas of the prostate. Treatment is the same as classical adenocarcinoma with an emphasis on aggressive multimodal treatment.",0,1285
512,"The state of Yucatan, in Mexico, is an endemic area for dengue. During 2015, there was an unpredicted increase in the number of expected cases of dengue fever. OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse the clinical presentation, progress, and management of a case of dengue infection with non-specific clinical manifestations in an infant which resulted in a dengue shock syndrome. CASE REPORT: One month old infant admitted to hospital with a generalised rash and a history of being bitten by an insect. He was diagnosed with anaphylaxis based on clinical manifestations and anamnesis. While in hospital, he developed hypotension, tachycardia, anaemia, and respiratory distress. He was transferred to the intensive care unit, but died on the fifth day. He tested positive to dengue virus in the PCR test and for IgG antibodies using Elisa. The basic cause of death was dengue shock syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever in young infant infections may be afebrile, so it is important to suspect them appropriately in the presence of a generalised rash, tachycardia, and hypotension, in order to avoid the deadly consequences of dengue shock.",0,1132
513,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 51 year-old woman with a firm mass at the medial canthus of the right eye of five years onset. A low-grade lymphoproliferative lesion (reactive lymphoid hyperplasia) was diagnosed from an excisional biopsy DISCUSSION: Lacrimal sac tumors are rare, with a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. The initial clinical features are epiphora and medial canthus swelling. As it mimics nasolacrimal duct obstruction, up to 40% of these tumors are misdiagnosed until undergoing surgery.",0,523
514,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 3-year-old girl with an erythematous oedematous plaque associated with blepharitis, and chalazion in the right upper eyelid. She received empirical treatment with topical corticosteroids, as well as an antifungal and antibiotic, without observing any improvement. The culture of the eyelid scrape showed Microsporum canis. Therefore, she was prescribed oral terbinafine and topical miconazole-betamethasone, achieving a clinical and microbiological recovery. DISCUSSION: Eyelid infection due to dermatophytes is uncommon, but it should be considered among the diagnostic suspicions of palpebral skin lesions. The microbiological study is a key factor for its diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",0,735
515,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 32 year-old male with no medical history of interest who suffered a traffic accident with mild traumatic brain injury. He had a left supraciliary incised and contused wound that extended to the left upper eyelid, with no loss of vision. After palpebral anaesthetic injection, there was a sudden visual acuity decrease in the left eye and hyposphagma located between I-III at 4mm from the limbus, with increased intraocular pressure. A whitish lesion with a central haemorrhagic focus was observed in the ocular fundus, corresponding to the area where the hyposphagma was located. DISCUSSION: Anaesthetic injection during palpebral repair may be complicated by inadvertent penetration of the eyeball. Intravitreal mepivacaine and adrenaline could cause macular and retinal lesions.",0,820
516,"Hypertension is a prevalent disease in developed countries. Adrenal masses, and especially adrenal cysts, are a rare and usually asymptomatic finding, which can go unnoticed or be detected as incidental findings in imaging tests. These circumstances make the multidisciplinary approach mandatory. The case is presented on a 72 year-old woman with uncontrolled high blood pressure referred to the Urology Department due to the incidental finding of a right retroperitoneal mass. A functional and imaging study was performed, establishing a diagnosis of adrenal cyst causing hypertensive symptoms. A literature search was performed in order to assess diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. With the diagnosis of adrenal cyst causing uncontrolled high blood pressure, a right laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed. After surgery the patient has maintained blood pressure within the normal range. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the management of rare diseases. The surgical approach, if possible, should be laparoscopic.",0,1034
517,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 64-year-old woman with bilateral palpebral swelling and dacryoadenitis, exophthalmos, and a history of chronic rhinitis and asthma. An increase in serum IgG4 was observed, and an incisional biopsy of lacrimal glands was performed, which showed fibrosis and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with IgG4 producing cells.

Histopathology is essential for the diagnosis and to exclude malignancy.",0,555
518,"Angioedema induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is a rare entity characterized by skin and mucosal edema, due to increased vascular permeability caused by inhibition of the converting enzyme and subsequent increase in bradykinin. It frequently presents with facial and mucosal involvement, being uncommon the intestinal or airway compromise. Intestinal angioedema may be associated with facial or isolated angioedema, the latter being exceptional. It is associated with recurrent episodes of pain, abdominal distention and watery diarrhea which complete recovery in two or three days. Although it is a rare entity, the fact that it is associated with frequently used drugs makes us include it in the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain. We report a case of isolated intestinal angioedema associated with the use of enalapril.",0,855
519,"Although there are currently less invasive techniques available for the treatment of spinal injuries, open surgery is still required in many cases. Vascular injuries occurring during lumbar spine surgery, although uncommon, are of great importance due to their potential gravity. Clinical manifestations vary from an acute hemorrhagic shock that needs urgent treatment to save the patient's life, to insidious injuries or an asymptomatic evolution, and should be studied to choose the best therapeutic alternative. Four cases are reported that represent this range of possibilities and emphasize the importance of a careful surgical technique during lumbar spine interventions, and the need for high clinical suspicion, essential for the early diagnosis of these vascular complications. The current therapeutic options are also discussed.",0,838
520,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic modality with significant antimicrobial activity. We present 2 cases of chronic lower limb ulcers in which fungal and bacterial superinfection complicated management. PDT with methylene blue as the photosensitizer led to clinical and microbiological cure with no significant adverse effects.

521,"Background: Focal dermal hypoplasia or Goltz syndrome is a rare X-linked dominant inherited genodermatosis, affecting both the ectodermal and mesodermal tissue. Clinical manifestations include skin abnormalities, defects in eyes, teeth, nails, mouth, soft tissues and skeleton. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and is suspected in individuals with ectodermal abnormalities and characteristic malformations in the extremities. The management is multidisciplinary and, like the prognosis, depends on the specific alterations that each patient presents. Case report: We report the case of a 15-day-old female newborn with alopecic areas on the scalp, herniation of subcutaneous cellular tissue at the lumbar level, nasal wing notch, severe left superior limb defect with rhizomelia (proximal segment shortening) and radio aplasia, as well as right leg ectrodactyly, areas of atrophy compatible with focal dermal hypoplasia according to diagnostic criteria.

522,"Vascular graft infections are a rare complication in this type of procedure. However, when they do occur, they usually have high morbidity, and even a high mortality. Proper identification and location is crucial for the appropriate and early management, whether medical or surgical, thus knowledge of the right tools is paramount. Nuclear medicine studies play an important role in this regard, either by using labelled white blood cells scintigraphy or (18)F-FDG. The choice, among other factors, will depend on the experience with both techniques by the different groups, their knowledge of them, as well as their availability. Two cases are presented in which (99m)Tc-HMPAO-white blood cells SPECT/CT scintigraphy was very useful in the diagnosis and location of the suspected infectious compromise, which led to the subsequent appropriate and guided management. Both cases were confirmed clinically and microbiologically.",0,926
523,"A 67 year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 2 no medical background of interest was attended in hospital due to visual loss of left eye of 4 months of onset. The fundus examination revealed findings corresponding to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the right eye and pigmented lesions similar to bone spicules and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium in the middle periphery and in the macular area in the left eye. The full-field electroretinogram was flat, with a slight insinuation of the b-wave in the light adaptation with a single flash of 3.0cd in the left eye. The optical coherence tomography showed the atrophic retina in all its layers, as well as intraretinal cysts and a serous neurosensory detachment of the macular retina with a lesion of high reflectivity in the left eye. Infectious and inflammatory diseases were ruled out. Three doses of intravitreal ranibizumab were administered monthly. The presence of choroidal neovascular membrane associated with unilateral retinitis pigmentosa has not been previously reported. The patient improved with intravitreal ranibizumab.",0,1116

526,"UNLABELLED: Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative infection, produced by anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria or microaerobic Actinomyces species. It is rare in children and adolescents and it is more common in immunocompromised. Mycobacterium tuberculosis collaborates on the development of the disease. Pulmonary involvement appears as a picture of chronic condensation that does not improve with conventional antibiotic treatment. Classic complications affecting the thoracic wall with drainage in <<sulfur granule>> and fistulization are described less frequently nowadays. The diagnosis is a real challenge and it is set by using the isolation of species of Actinomyces. The treatment of choice for all clinical forms of the disease is the prolonged use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: to present a pediatric case of comorbidity between tuberculosis and actinomycosis and to highlight the importance of diagnostic suspicion of actinomycosis in the presence of all chronic suppurative processes.",0,991
527,"Some patients use complementary medicine. We present a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma, scanned with (18)F-FDG PET/CT for evaluation of response after chemotherapy, who was self-administering mistletoe as a homeopathic medicine product. The careful review of the images of the entire scan and patient collaboration in anamnesis were crucial to avoid a false positive result.

528,"INTRODUCTION: According to the 1981 International League Against Epilepsy classification, absence seizures are the paradigm of idiopathic generalised seizures of childhood. Although absences are mainly of an idiopathic origin, there are also symptomatic absences, which account for 10% of all cases of absences. It is thought that a structural pathology can favour the appearance of absences in genetically predisposed individuals. CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of two patients with symptomatic absence seizures of childhood onset. The first presented thalamic damage of a perinatal origin and the second had glucose transporter deficiency in the brain. CONCLUSION: A percentage of absence seizures in childhood are of a symptomatic origin. This occurs more frequently in children who present other types of epilepsy, focal or diffuse brain damage, and in early-onset absences.",0,881
529,"Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing tumour arising from remnants of the notochord. It is most often located in the base of the skull and the sacrococcygeal region, being located in the cervical region in only 6% of cases. A rare case is presented of a left para-spinal chordoma, of which less than 10 cases have been reported in literature. It was located at C2-C4 level in a young male with no personal history of interest. Radiographic findings suggested that this was a slow-growing tumour, of cystic dominance, which eroded the bone structures and encompassed the left vertebral artery. Surgical excision was performed, and in the analysis of the surgical piece, cell proliferation was observed, with a stromal myxoid-chondroid appearance, epithelioid and physaliphorous (PAS+) cells, all of them compatible with chordoma.",0,823
530,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of foveal and macular intraretinal hemorrhages in an immunocompetent male patient with visceral leishmaniasis. CASE REPORT: An immunocompetent, 42 year-old male, presented with progressive visual loss and metamorphopsia in his right eye. The fundus examination showed a foveal round yellow lesion and intraretinal hemorrhages in the macula. The patient was hospitalized with fever, anorexia, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive anemia. Laboratory studies were conducted and a positive test for leishmaniasis and hepatitis A was reported. Treatment was begun with amphotericin B 50mg/day up to a total dose of 1400mg. CONCLUSION: Bilateral retinal hemorrhages in an endemic country could suggest the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.",0,776
531,"Background: Achondrogenesis is a skeletal dysplasia characterized primarily by short stature, severe micromelia, short and narrow chest, prematurity, polyhydramnios, fetal hydrops, and in utero or neonatal death. Based on the radiological and histopathological findings, there are three types of achondrogenesis: type 1A (Houston-Harris), type 1B (Fraccaro) and type 2 (Langer-Saldino). Clinical case: A premature female product was studied whose clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics were compatible with achondrogenesis Type 1A. The family information allowed us to conclude that the 4 products of the 6 previous pregnancies were affected. Statistical analysis in at least 4 families previously described, including this family case showed significant differences between expected and observed number of members, being incongruent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance previously reported. Conclusions: therefore, it could be considered a new subtype of achondrogenesis type 1A due to the presence of a preferential germline mutation.",0,1069
532,"The growing rod technique is currently one of the most common procedures used in the management of early onset scoliosis. However, in order to preserve spine growth and control the deformity it requires frequent surgeries to distract the rods. Magnetically driven growing rods have recently been introduced with same treatment goal, but without the inconvenience of repeated surgical distractions. One of the limitations of this technical advance is an increase in radiation exposure due to the increase in distraction frequency compared to conventional growing rods. An improvement of the original technique is presented, proposing a solution to the inconvenience of multiple radiation exposure using ultrasound technology to control the distraction process of magnetically driven growing rods.",0,795
533,"Bloody discharge from the nipple (thelorrhagia) is a rare symptom in childhood and is a cause of great concern due to the association with carcinoma in adults. The most common cause in children is mammary duct ectasia, which is a benign and self-limiting condition. It is characterized by dilatation of the mammary ducts, fibrosis and periductal inflammation. The etiology has not been identified and is multifactorial. Up to date, only isolated case reports have been published. Therefore, we present a review of the literature and we report a case of a fivemonth- old male infant that resolves spontaneously. We aimed to improve physicians' diagnosis accuracy, the knowledge of this condition and to avoid aggressive studies and treatments.",0,742

537,"INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent mood disease that includes symptoms that fluctuate from euphoria to depression. As a mood disorder, itis one of the main contraindications for transplantation procedures. The case is presented of a patient with bipolar disorder who had a heart transplant after a cardiac arrest. Heart transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with heart failure and arrhythmias that do not respond to conventional treatment. METHODS: Case report and narrative review of literature. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old woman with bipolar disorder diagnosed when she was 13, treated with lithium and aripiprazole. She required a heart transplant as the only therapeutic option, after presenting with ventricular tachycardia refractory to conventional treatment. The patient did not suffer an emotional decompensation with the removal of the lithium and aripiprazole that were associated with prolonged QTc interval, and remained eurhythmic throughout the process. DISCUSSION: Heart transplantation can be performed safely and successfully in patients with bipolar disorder, when suitably followed-up by a liaison psychiatry group. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for heart transplantation.",0,1288
538,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory pseudotumour is a rare entity, considered benign, and characterised by inflammatory cell mesenchymal proliferation. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented 70 year-old man with fever of unknown origin syndrome. He was diagnosed with liver abscesses (one segment IV, adjacent to gallbladder fundus and segment VI), who progressed slowly after antibiotic treatment. In the absence of a diagnosis, although fine needle puncture-aspiration and different imaging tests were performed, elective surgery was decided. The intra-operative histopathology reported the existence of an inflammatory pseudotumour. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory pseudotumours are clinically classified into different types according to their aetiology, varying therapeutic management based on the same. It is very difficult to diagnose because of the absence of symptoms, blood disorders, or specific radiological findings. Definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological confirmation, in most cases by percutaneous liver puncture, but sometimes exploratory laparotomy or even performing a hepatectomy for confirmation is necessary. The natural history of inflammatory pseudotumour is its regression; thus conservative management may be used through regular checks until resolution, or can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and even corticosteroids. Surgical resection is indicated for persistent unresolved systemic symptoms despite medical treatment, in those situations where growth is evident, with or without symptoms, when involving the hepatic hilum, and finally, in case where the possibility of malignancy cannot be ruled out.",0,1643
539,"Infection with the orf virus, also known as contagious ecthyma, is recognized as an occupational zoonosis worldwide. It is diagnosed by cutaneous lesions that progress rapidly from macules to papules, vesicles and pustules. The clinical case of a student of veterinary medicine who had had contact with goats, clinically healthy and without apparent lesions, which occured 19 days ago, is reported. She presented two vesicular lesions that coalesced to form a larger lesion surrounded by an erythematous halo. The lesions were compatible with the classical presentation of those produced by the orf virus in humans. The presence of the orf virus was confirmed by a nested PCR from biopsy tissue. It is one of the first cases confirmed by molecular techniques in humans in Chile.",0,778

It most frequently compromises patients with terminal chronic renal failure and has a high mortality rate. Biopsy of skin lesions is used as a diagnostic method. No specific laboratory findings have been recorded. Skin lesions usually begin in the extremities like a painful purplish mottling similar to ""livedo reticularis"". The natural evolution is to ulcers and bedsores. The first line of treatment involves the care of skin lesions and antibiotic therapy. Sodium thiosulfate is used as treatment due to its antioxidant activity and as a chelating. Two clinical cases are here reported.",0,760
541,"The Korea Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first confirmed on May 20, 2015, with a subsequent outbreak in South Korea. Five patients with suspected MERS-CoA infection were admitted to our hospital during this outbreak. One patient had no major symptoms upon admission, but pneumonia was identified upon chest radiography. Two patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure and required ventilator-assisted respiration. One patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to treat refractory hypoxemia, and one patient died of shock with multiorgan failure. All the patients had fever, myalgia, leucopenia, normal procalcitonin level, and pneumonia. Importantly, clinicians should test for pneumonia in all suspected patients with MERS-CoV infection, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The pneumonia usually affected the lower lobes. A shorter incubation period was associated with more severe disease and greater risk of mortality, and the severity of fever predicted the prognosis of MERS-CoV infection-related pneumonia. Therefore, in cases of lower-lobe pneumonia that occur during an MERS-CoV outbreak and are unesponsive to antibiotics, clinicians should consider the possibility of MERS-CoV infection.",1,1259
542,"Approximately 2 million people die each year from tuberculosis. One third of the world s population is estimated to be infected with the tuberculosis bacillus, although only 5-10% will develop the disease in their lifetime. The disease progression risk depends on endogenous and exogenous factors. Indigenous communities are a high-risk group for infection and development of tuberculosis. In addition to factors such as geographical isolation, social and cultural neglect and malnutrition, susceptibility to genetic polymorphisms has been identified in them. Spinal tuberculosis is the most destructive form of the disease, which represents approximately half of all cases of skeletal tuberculosis. The case of an HIV negative, indigenous Colombian man is presented. His diagnosis was done based on clinical and image findings, and it was confirmed with the rapid molecular assay Genotype MTBDRplus(R) and IS6110 PCR.The culture in solid media was negative after 16 weeks.

548,"Toxocariasis canis or catis is a zoonotic infection disseminated in humans. Human beings can act as non-natural hosts in which the parasite can survive for long periods of time and they become infected by the ingestion of geohelminth eggs. These can be located on the ground, playgrounds and children's games, and are mostly eliminated by dogs or cats. There are different spectra in the clinical presentation of this infection, which can vary from an asymptomatic host to the production of serious organic lesions; some of them are ocular toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans, covert toxocariasis and neurotoxocariasis. In this case report a patient who presents with a history of respiratory problems, prolonged fever, and hepatomegaly.

550,"Introduction: Congenital pulmonary malformations are a rare cause of neonatal morbidity. Some of them have a common origin, which allows the identification of combined lesions. Its diagnosis can be made prenatally by ultrasound, with the limitation that this study is performed in specialized centers and depends on the expertise of the operator. The association of pulmonary sequestration and congenital malformation of the airway has been described in approximately 40-60 cases since its first description in 1949. Many lesions are not perceptible in intrauterine life and in the neonatal period there are recurrent respiratory symptoms that in some cases are associated with a congenital pulmonary malformation. Case report: We report the case of a young infant, who was diagnosed with pulmonary sequestration at 24 weeks of gestational age, undergoing intrauterine surgical treatment with a report of complete resolution of the malformation in posterior ultrasounds. She was valued by pediatric pneumology at 4 months of age, where angiotomography was performed and the presence of pulmonary sequestration was confirmed by lobectomy. The histopathological study reported extralobar pulmonary sequestration with congenital malformation of the pulmonary airway type 2. These combined lesions were identified by histopathological study. The treatment of choice was surgical. Conclusions: Upon the confirmation of a malformation, we emphasize the importance of performing a screening in order to search for other that could be associated.",0,1538

552,Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disorder caused by Bartonella henselae and characterized by fever and granulomatous lymphadenopathy. Immunosuppression is a risk factor for the development of atypical forms of the disease. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented with fever and bilateral inguinal lymph node enlargement. She did not have apparent contact with animals. The patient was receiving etanercept therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Lymph node biopsy demonstrated granulomatous lymphadenitis. She was successfully managed by discontinuing etanercept and by treatment with minocycline. She developed clinical remission and typical seroconversion. Infection with Bartonella should be considered in the differential diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients with lymphadenopathy of unknown origin.,0,828
553,"INTRODUCTION: Nephron-sparing surgery is reporting satisfactory oncological results, with improved quality of life. The laparoscopic approach is technically complex and requires advanced skills; however, the use of robotic systems facilitates the transition to this procedure. With improved strategies for diagnosis and follow-up, as well as ablative technologies, the role of partial nephrectomy continuous to evolve. The use of water-jet technology to dissect and resect organs helps create anatomical planes in a relatively blood-free field, which improves vision and does not cause heat damage. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the case of a patient with an incidental diagnosis of a complex right renal cyst managed with robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy using hydrodissection for tumour resection. RESULTS: The surgery was performed with 2 robotic arms. Four ports were routinely placed, the colon was mobilised, and the tumour was dissected. Tumour delimitation was performed with laparoscopic ultrasound, and the renal artery was clamped. We then performed the tumour resection assisted by a laparoscopic water-jet applicator, operated by the assistant through an auxiliary port. The renal parenchyma was reconstructed in 2 planes, without knots, and the arterial clamp was withdrawn at 23minutes. The resection margins were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The use of water-jet technology to assist with the renal tumour resection during minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery facilitates the dissection, making it more fluid and atraumatic. Simultaneously, the technique provides a clean surgical field, which improves visibility. This procedure can help decrease ischaemia times, thereby positively affecting the patient's evolution without compromising the oncological results.",0,1797

555,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case report of bilateral posterior tarsal tunnel syndrome (PTTS) caused by an accessory flexor digitorum longus (AFDL), including the surgical technique and a review of the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine year old male diagnosed with bilateral PTTS, refractory to conservative management, with 53 points on the preoperative AOFAS score. MR of both ankles showed an AFDL within the tarsal tunnel, in close relationship to the posterior tibial nerve. Bilateral tarsal tunnel decompression and AFDL resection was performed. RESULTS: There were no post-operative complications. At 6 months after surgery, the patient had no pain and had 87 points on the AOFAS score. DISCUSSION: The PTTS is an entrapment neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve or one of its terminal branches. A rare cause is the presence of an AFDL, and its resection is associated with good clinical results. Careful scar tissue resection and neurolysis is recommended. Knowing the normal pathway and anatomical variability of the posterior tibial nerve and its branches is essential to avoid iatrogenic injury. In our case report, MR and intraoperative findings identified a bilateral FDLA in close relationship to the common flexor digitorum, an unusual finding, with few reports in current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Careful tarsal tunnel decompression and AFDL resection in our patient with bilateral symptomatic PTTS has good clinical results and no complications, particularly when diagnosed and treated early.",0,1520
556,"Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in subtropical rainforests of Latin America. Acute/subacute presentations involve an aggressive dissemination throughout the lymphatic system, while chronic forms (more frequent) arise as differential diagnosis for other conditions involving lung, oropharynx, skin, and eventually the brain. We present the case of a man referred for evaluation and treatment of a possible lung tumor with brain metastasis. The finding of multibudded yeasts and the microbiological isolation of a dimorphic fungus identified as Paracoccidioides sp. from a brain biopsy prompted a cardinal change in prognosis and treatment. This case alerts on the importance of considering systemic fungal diseases as differential diagnosis of compatible clinical presentations in patients who had lived in, or visited, endemic areas.",0,835
557,"INTRODUCTION: Pleuropulmonary blastema (PPB) is the most common primary malignancy of the lungs in childhood. It occurs more frequently in children between one and four years of age, and respiratory symptoms are a common manifestation. Three types have been defined (type I, II and III), which are related to survival and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of a patient with a PPB who presented with a chest wall deformity. CASE REPORT: One year old male patient who had a chest wall deformity at ten months of age. Imaging revealed a giant cyst in the right hemithorax. He did not develop respiratory symptoms until hospital admission. A right upper lobectomy was perfor med and the biopsy confirmed a type I pleuropulmonary blastoma. He was considered successfully treated with complete surgical excision and routine follow-up with thoracic imaging is conducted. CONCLUSIONS: PPB is a very rare cancer that needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lung diseases in children. The recognition of this lesion as a malignant tumour rather than a developmental cystic malformation is vital so the child can receive complete excision and appropriate follow-up care.",0,1195
558,"BACKGROUND: Cervical thoracic duct cysts are a rare anomaly. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of cervical thoracic duct cyst, and perform a literature review. CLINICAL CASE: A 78-year-old female, with a one-year history of a left-sided asymptomatic supraclavicular cystic mass. Computerized tomography revealed a cystic mass 42mm in diameter. We performed a fine needle aspiration puncture, obtaining a thick, milky, whitish liquid. The patient underwent surgery; finding a left-sided supraclavicular cystic mass, with some lymph vessels heading towards the jugulo subclavian venous junction. We performed a ligation of these lymph vessels and resection of the mass. The histopathologic study confirmed the diagnosis of thoracic duct cyst. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of cervical thoracic duct cyst should be suspected with a cystic lesion in the left supraclavicular region, which when perforated exudes a very distinctive thick milky, whitish liquid with a high content of lymphocytes and triglycerides. Treatment should be complete removal with ligation of the lymphatic afferent vessels.",0,1080
559,"CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns an 81-year-old woman on treatment with a topical fixed combination of timolol and brimonidine who was diagnosed in the Emergency Department with acute anterior granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. The patient responded favourably to the withdrawal of the eye drops without showing any subsequent relapse. DISCUSSION: Uveitis due to brimonidine is a rare adverse effect, but it must be known. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the effective treatment is the withdrawal of brimonidine, with or without the addition of topical corticosteroids to control inflammation depending on the severity of the condition. It is a process with an excellent prognosis.",0,683
560,"Scimitar syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by anomalous drainage of the right pulmonary veins in the inferior vena cava, frequently associated with right lung and pulmonary artery hypoplasia, dextrocardia and abnormal systemic arterial supply to the lower lobe. Pulmonary resection surgery on healthy lung is exceptional, and there are no published records of it, as far as we know. A man with scimitar syndrome diagnosed with a lung nodule with malignant features in the contralateral lung. This situation implies huge anaesthetic complexity, mainly for intraoperative ventilation. Although spirometry and stress test did not contraindicate the planned lobectomy, scintigraphy showed a hypoplastic right lung with an uptake of 15%. From an anaesthetic point of view we discarded selective ventilation of the right lung, since the shunt made it functionally non-existent. In consequence we proposed four anaesthetic possibilities. After the placement of an epidural catheter and left selective intubation, thoracoscopy with intermittent apnoeas was our first choice, and we could complete the extirpation and avoid excessive complexity.",0,1154

565,"Pharyngeal tuberculosis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation. In Argentina, the number of cases of tuberculosis reported in children under 19 years in 2012 was 1752. Only 12.15% had extrapulmonary manifestation. A case of a 17 year old girl with pharyngeal tuberculosis is reported. The patient presented intermittent fever and swallowing pain for 6 months, without response to conventional antibiotic treatment. Chest X-ray showedbilateral micronodular infiltrate, so hospitalization was decided to study and treat. The sputum examination for acid-fast resistant bacilli was positive and treatment with four antituberculous drugs was started, with good evolution and disappearance of symptoms. Diagnostic confirmation with the isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum culture was obtained. The main symptoms of pharyngeal tuberculosis are sore throat and difficulty in swallowing of long evolution. It is important to consider tuberculosis as differential diagnosis in patients with chronic pharyngitis unresponsive to conventional treatment.",0,1054
566,"Necrotizing tracheobronchitis due to Aspergillus spp is a rare form of invasive aspergillosis. This infection is limited to or predominant in the bronchial tree. The clinical evolution is gradual: from mild non-specific manifestations of acute tracheobronchitis to severe acute respiratory insufficiency determined by a bronchial obstruction syndrome. We report a 38 years old female with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. She developed an invasive aspergillosis, severe respiratory failure with predominant tracheobronchial damage and upper respiratory complications.",0,617
567,"Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a group of rare genetic disorders that share organ targeted resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as a common feature. Biochemically, they may present with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH. Some forms present with a specific phenotype: short stature, round facies, short neck, obesity, brachydactyly and subcutaneous calcifications, called Albrigth's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO). This spectrum of disorders are caused by several alterations in the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the G protein (GNAS): an ubiquitous signaling protein that mediates the action of numerous hormones such as PTH, TSH, gonadotropins, and ACTH, among others. According to their inheritance with maternal or paternal imprinting, they may manifest in a diversity of clinical forms. Although most commonly diagnosed during childhood, PHP may manifest clinically during adolescence or early adulthood. We report two late presenting cases of pseudohypoparathyroidism. A 21-year-old female with biochemical abnormalities characteristic of pseudohypoparathyroidism who was misdiagnosed as epilepsy and a 13-year-old boy with the classic AHO phenotype but without alterations in phospho-calcium metabolism, compatible with pseudopseudohypoparathyrodism.",0,1298
568,"A 12 year old child was brought in by his parents due to persistent fever of 3 weeks duration, sore throat, malaise, chills, small joint arthralgia, myalgias, and a pink macular rash. The first clinical impression of the physicians was infectious mononucleosis but serologic testing ruled out the diagnosis. He was then treated with oral ampicillin without a favorable response. He was referred to us for a second evaluation. A detailed clinical history revealed that he had a few days of vacation in a rural area in the northern region of the province of Cordoba, in close contact with horses, dogs and cats. His parents found 2 ticks on his abdomen, and removed them with tweezers. Serology and blood count carried out in a specialized laboratory showed positive titers (> 160) for Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Further confirmation was obtained using genus-specific polymerase chain reaction. After a 3-week course of doxycicline the patient recovered and serological titers decreased.",0,981
569,"INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is a rare progressive subacute encephalopathy of early onset - generally in the first year of life - characterised by psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, alterations in the white matter of the brain, intracranial calcifications, pleocytosis and elevated levels of interferon alpha in the cerebrospinal fluid. It is associated to an increase in the expression of genes stimulated by interferon in peripheral blood, a fact known as the interferon signature. The levels of genes stimulated by interferon has been postulated as a good biomarker, as they remain high in peripheral blood over time and are more sensitive, in comparison to determinations of interferon alpha and neopterins in cerebrospinal fluid, which descend as of one year of life. To date, mutations have been reported in seven genes that overstimulate the interferon alpha pathway, and the last to be discovered is IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1), with a pattern of dominant autosomal inheritance. CASE REPORT: We present the first case reported in the Hispanic literature caused by a de novo mutation in the IFIH1 gene. The clinical features, studies conducted and review of the clinical, neuroradiological and genetic aspects are described. CONCLUSIONS: The inheritance of the mutations reported for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome was classically considered as being recessive autosomal, but these findings show that dominant autosomal mutations in the IFIH1 gene can cause the disease. As a previously unreported neuroimaging finding, it presents a lesion consisting in cystic encephalomalacia in the pons.",0,1634
570,"Primary synovial sarcoma of the breast is very rare. We report a case of a 33-year-old woman, who had previously undergone a radical mastectomy, having been diagnosed with fusocellular breast carcinoma. Histopathology revealed a hypercellular lesion formed by spindle cells with storiform and herringbone patterns. Immunohistochemistry showed strong expression of vimentin and CD99, and focal bcl2, EMA, CK AE1-AE3, actin and desmin, with negativity for S100, CD34, CK7, CK14, CK19, hormone receptors, caldesmon and myosin. Molecular biology revealed the expression of the fusion product of the SS18 and SSX genes, indicative of the translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which confirmed the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma.",0,719
571,"We report a case of a middle-age male patient, with newly HIV infection in AIDS stage diagnosis, no comorbitidies, who was hospitalized for subacute malaise, fever, self-limited unproductive cough and no bloody chronic diarrea. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia was performed by imagenological suspicion and stains of cysts of this pathogen with bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Treatment was initiated with oral cotrimoxazole and starting HAART with good clinical outcome. Concomitantly, an etiologic study was conducted for chronic diarrhea and through histopathological examination of colonic mucosa, numerous extracellular cystic structures Pneumocystis characteristics were observed, performing the diagnosis of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis is a rare cause of P. jiroveci infection, requires a high index of suspicion and should be approached in HIV patients with severe AIDS which is common in co-infection of various infections and is peremptory to make an etiologic diagnosis and early treatment.",0,1050

573,"Dapagliflozin, an insulin-independent sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2-I) induces glycosuria and reduces hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To present an euglycemic diabetic ketosis in an adolescent with type 1 diabetes (T1D) receiving dapagliflozin, to alert about the risk of a drug not approved in children nor in T1D. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old adolescent with T1D during 9 years, was started on dapagliflozin 10 mg / day to reduce insulin dose and weight. During 11 months on treatment, capillaries ketones were undetectable and she exhibited a reduction in body mass index 23.9 to 21.1 kg/m2, basal insulin 40 to 17 U, glycated hemoglobin 8.3 to 7.5%, capillary glucose 175 to 161 mg/dl and glucose variability (standard deviation) 85 to 77. Suddenly nausea and vomits appeared. The patient was on an insulin pump and well calibrated continuous glucose monitoring, showing stable glucose levels under 200 mg/dl, and an insulin bolus was delivered. Vomiting without hyperglycemia persisted; three hours later, she was severely dehydrated and fainting, with ketones 4.6 nmol/l and glucose 224 mg/dl. She received IV saline fluids, ondansetron, carbohydrates and several insulin boluses. Hydration and general condition improved soon, however despite several insulin doses, ketosis continued for 24 hours. It is remarkable that the pump was working well and the cannula was not changed. After the ketosis was resolved, she continued using the same cannula with good metabolic control. CONCLUSION: Euglycemic ketosis is a life-threatening condition that must be suspected.",0,1612
574,"Necrotizing scleritis is an immune-mediated ocular inflammatory process, characterized by an area of avascular necrosis and a profound inflammation of the sclera and episclera. Necrotizing scleritis and its association with peripheral ulcerative keratitis--necrotizing sclerokeratitis (NS)--represents a serious threat for vision and eye integrity, evolves very fast if untreated, and its finding suggests the presence of a potentially lethal systemic vasculitic process. The following case is an example of the diagnostic approach and therapeutic scale in a 63-year-old women with necrotizing sclerokeratitis.",0,610
575,"Cyclodialysis is the result of the separation of the longitudinal fibres of the ciliary muscle from their scleral insertion, creating states of ocular hypotony. It is mainly caused by traumatisms. Gonioscopy has traditionally been the diagnostic test for this entity, however, at present it is being replaced by other techniques, such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). We present the case of a 57-year-old male who, following a traumatism in the left eye caused by the disc of a radial saw, presented corneal perforation and vitreous haemorrhage with pan-retinal edema. The gonioscopy was normal in spite of the existence of persistent ocular hypotony. The realization of a UBM enabled diagnosis of a small cyclodialysis of less than ten degrees. Surgical treatment made it possible to recover normal intraocular pressure.",0,823
576,"CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old woman with a bilateral loss of visual acuity and a history of IgA nephropathy.

578,"An 80 year-old woman with no relevant medical history, consulted for worsening of right palpebral itching and pain after an insect bite. Her eyelids had areas of laceration due to scratching, which rapidly progressed to fibrinoid necrosis over the first 24hours. Lesions were cultivated, revealing Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of periorbital necrotising fasciitis, in order to receive treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone, linezolid, and immediate surgical debridement. She remained in hospital for 17 days. Daily wound management consisted of debridement of necrotic remains, disinfection with chlorhexidine, and wound dressing with mupirocin, sulfadiazine, and miconazole ointments. The patient suffered streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, but she recovered over the first week. Palpebral reconstruction was performed on day 15, consisting of a preauricular total thickness skin graft for the superior eyelid, and lateral malar advancement to cover the lower eyelid. Adequate cosmetic and functional results were obtained.",0,1103
579,"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in neonates and infants. Presentation of SVT in the neonate is usually subtle and frequently complicated by congestive heart failure. Despite the widespread use of beta2-agonists, their safety has been questioned. Several studies have reported an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with these agents, and other studies have found increased rates of cardiovascular death associated with the use of oral and nebulized beta2-agonists such as salbutamol, which is used to treat bronchospasm in newborns with several diseases. Herein, we report a case of SVT following administration of nebulized salbutamol in a neonate.",0,719
580,"BACKGROUND: Central serous choroidopathy is a macular disease, usually with a self-limited and benign course, and predominantly affects male patients between 20 and 45 years old. CLINICAL CASE: A 68 year-old female patient complained of decreased visual acuity of her right eye of approximately 3 weeks of onset. Best corrected visual acuity in her right eye was 20/100. Fundus examination revealed a macular serous detachment involving its centre, as well as the presence of multiple calcified drusen. Fluorescein angiography showed late parafoveal leakage in a ""smokestack"" pattern in the right macular area. Optical coherence tomography showed a dome-shape macular detachment, also in the right eye. The patient was observed every 2 weeks and spontaneous resolution of the macular detachment was seen a month later. Based on these clinical features, a diagnosis was made of central serous choroidopathy of atypical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentation cases of serous central choroidopathy might be seen occasionally. Hence, it is an important differential diagnosis of age related macular degeneration in patients older than 60 years.",0,1150
581,"Background: Mullerian adenosarcoma is a rare gynecological malignancy with a low malignant potential, with biphasic growth, consisting of a benign epithelial element and a malignant mesenchymal element. It occurs in all ages predominating in postmenopausal women. Cervical localization of Mullerian adenosarcomas is rare; however, it is associated with a presentation in young women. The diagnosis is made by anatomopathological study of the lesion and immunohistochemistry. The prognosis is generally good although the recurrence rate is high. Clinical case: We present the case of a 27-year-old patient who attended a gynecological consultation with bleeding and transvaginal flow. During the gynecological examination, a polypoid lesion originating in the cervix was identified, which was removed by torsion and was diagnosed as Mullerian cervical adenosarcoma. Subsequently, a cervical cone was performed because the patient refused hysterectomy. Conclusions: Mullerian cervical adenosarcoma is a rare neoplasm with a recurrence rate that can reach up to 50% of cases, so close follow-up is necessary. A local excision can be considered in patients without poor prognosis factors and who wish to preserve their fertility.",0,1225

584,"Wunderlich syndrome, or spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma, secondary to spontaneous rupture of the iliac vein is a rare clinical entity and a medical emergency. Often the aetiology is difficult to identify and different hypotheses have been proposed, such as the presence of hormonal, inflammatory and/or mechanical factors. It may be important to assess the presence of a factor that triggered the deep vein thrombosis and secondary rupture of the iliac vein and retroperitoneal hematoma. We present a case where venous thrombosis could have caused rupture of the iliac vein and we discuss the entity in light of the current literature.",0,640
585,"OBJECTIVE: We introduce two cases of a 46 and 66-year-old patient, both diagnosed with pelvic neurofibroma (One located in a seminal vesicle, the other in the bladder). The first patient had been diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type 1 while the other was diagnosed with a sporadic neurofibroma. METHODS: During a study for lower urinary tract symptoms referred, these patients were diagnosed seminal vesicle and bladder neurofibroma, respectively, using image and histological tests. RESULTS: The histopathological and inmunohistochemical characteristics of these benign tumors gave the definitive diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic neurofibromas are a rare entity in this anatomical location. They can be associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 or not. We get to their diagnosis by an anatomopathological study. Conservative management is the usual procedure, being mandatory a clinical follow-up that must be coupled with image tests.",0,934
586,"The relationship between Microscopic Colitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease is unclear. However, when both are diagnosed they seem to be part of a broader spectrum of the same disease, more than just a coincidence. We report a 55 years old woman with Ulcerative Colitis limited to the rectum with complete clinical and endoscopic response to standard treatment and adequate surveillance for 13 years, who abandoned treatment and control. After eight years, she consulted for mild-to-moderate non-bloody diarrhea lasting several months. Colonoscopy and basic laboratory did not show any alterations. Nevertheless, random biopsies had a characteristically pattern compatible with Lymphocytic Colitis. After the first week of treatment with budesonide the patient was asymptomatic and still in clinical remission, with negative fecal calprotectin at 6 months follow-up.",0,866
587,"Dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma is a variant in which a high grade osteosarcoma coexists with a parosteal osteosarcoma. We report the case of a 20-year-old female patient who presented with six months of evolution of pain and functional limitation of the right forearm, with no apparent cause; radiographs were performed, observing a tumoral lesion in the diaphysis of the right ulna. Physical examination showed pain upon palpation in the diaphysis of the ulna and limitation of prone-supination. Axial computed tomography of the thorax revealed metastatic disease in the upper lobe of the left lung. An incisional biopsy was performed on the right ulna, with a report of dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma. Therefore, the patient was managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin until completing three cycles. Surgical treatment consisted of intercalary resection of the diaphysis of the right ulna, plus reconstruction of the microvascularized autologous graft of the right fibular diaphysis and graft stabilization with 3.5 mm dynamic compression plate (DCP) and one-third tubular plate. In the same procedure, pulmonary metastasectomy was performed by thoracoscopy. Post-surgical histopathological report with 100% necrosis. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic, with no evidence of tumor activity. Dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma is a rare pathology, but should be suspected as a differential diagnosis in the presence of a parosteal osteosarcoma; it should be taken into account that this disease can metastasize due to its dedifferentiated pattern. It is important to plan a surgical treatment that allows an adequate functional reconstruction, always taking into account the oncological principle.",0,1753
588,"BACKGROUND: In the management of hydrocephalus, the ventriculo-gallbladder shunt is justified in situations where the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt is not useful due to peritoneal involvement and/or when the ventriculo-auricular and ventriculo-pleural shunts are contraindicated. CLINICAL CASE: A 27 year-old female with hydrocephalus at birth, managed with ventricle-peritoneal shunt, modified 3 times throughout her life due to repeated infections and other different reasons. She was admitted due to colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, presenting concomitant signs of intracranial hypertension and neurological impairment. This led to a review and change of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt system, with distal dysfunction due to peritoneal thickening. Atrial and pleural shunts were not indicated because the risk of infection. As an alternative, it was decided to place the distal end of the catheter in the gallbladder. The patient recovered her neurological functions after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Drainage alternatives may be needed in 5% of patients with valvular shunt dysfunction. The ventriculo-gallbladder is a good and viable option because it has an absorptive capacity of 1500cc liquid daily, besides being an excellent drainage through the bile duct. The abdominal surgery is easy to perform, and it is an alternative option in the failure of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.",0,1396

590,"Ataxia-telangiectasia is a disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, and increased predisposition to cancer susceptibility. Mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene seem to play an important role in normal cell function and in cardiovascular remodeling. We report a case of a 14-year-old boy with ataxia-telangiectasia and high-grade B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma who remained in continuous complete remission after chemotherapy and who was admitted into our Emergency Room presenting with episodes of presyncope. At admission he presented a complete atrioventricular block that evolved into asystole and required placement of a pacemaker. Cumulative cardiotoxic drugs received were at low risk. However, it is possible that this chronic degenerative disease may affect the cardiac conduction system over time. In the reviewed literature there are no or unknown reports of ataxia-telangiectasia with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.",0,971
591,"INTRODUCTION: Akinetic mutism is considered as an alteration of the motivational state of the person, which the patient is unable to initiate verbal or motor responses voluntary, even with preserved sensorimotor and surveillance functions. CASE REPORT: A 43 year-old male involved in a cerebellum arteriovenous fistula complicated with hydrocephalus, who responded dramatically to treatment with bromocriptine. CONCLUSION: Typically, akinetic mutism is described as a transient surgeries posterior fossa. However, it can also occur after multiple valvular failure in patients with hydrocephalus.",0,595
592,"CASE REPORT: A 10-month old infant was referred for the study of a leukocoria of the left eye of one month onset. On examination, a retinoblastoma occupying the macular area was detected. Treatment with intra-arterial chemotherapy (melphalan 6 mg) was performed, with no further intervention required for disease control. DISCUSSION: Melphalan is an effective chemotherapeutic agent. However, its use is limited by the systemic toxicity that may occur. Intra-arterial chemotherapy allows the selective release of melphalan into the ophthalmic artery, thus limiting its systemic toxicity. This combination of efficiency, safety and accuracy makes it an attractive therapeutic alternative for the management of retinoblastoma.",0,724
593,"Morphine produces contraction of Oddis sphincter, which can be severe and of longer duration in some pathological conditions. This exaggerated response can manifest as a colicky biliary pain, frequently accompanied by a dramatic increase in hepatic enzymes. We report a 32 years old female who consulted in the emergency room for severe low abdominal pain of gynecologic origin, which was completely controlled by morphine. However, she presented a sudden epigastric colicky pain irradiating in the back, which persisted for several hours in spite of the repeated administration of analgesics. Transaminases elevated from previously normal value to over 1,000 U/L, and returned to the normal level without further treatment after several days. Magnetic resonance cholangiography showed normal fine bile duct, without stones. This transient increase in hepatic enzymes was considered as a consequence of high biliary pressure secondary to morphine-induced spastic contraction of Oddis sphincter and a consecutive hepatocellular necrosis.",0,1036

We report a 73 years old man with a history compatible with of a rapidly progressive dementia, in which the first electroencephalographic study showed a pattern consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus. Besides discarding this diagnosis, it was necessary to rule out other causes of rapidly progressive dementia such as Hashimoto encephalopathy. Finally, the sustained clinical deterioration with no response to anticonvulsants and corticosteroids, the imaging studies, a serial electroencephalographic monitoring study and the detection of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid were the keys to achieve the diagnosis of the disease.",0,833
596,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are heterogeneous and frequently spread over the body, making their imaging difficult. With this aim, nuclear medicine imaging, using PET or SPECT with different tracers, has been proposed for decades, but there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate technique, even when only considering gastrointestinal NET. The case is presented of a 67year old woman with a well differentiated NET of the ileum with suspected recurrence, which was not detected by any imaging technique except (18)F-FDOPA PET/CT. Subsequent follow up showed disease progression, which confirmed the true positivity of (18)F-FDOPA.

However, the progress of these patients is usually slow, and many of them develop postherpetic neuritis (PHN). In the present paper, three clinical cases are presented, in which a significant symptomatic improvement was obtained by using a preauricular injection of a mixture of betamethasone depot combined with acyclovir. PHN did not develop in any of them. DISCUSSION: The preauricular injection of betamethasone depot and acyclovir could be a good alternative for the management of HZO.",0,615
598,"Anemia is very common in infants. Although its causes are usually not severe and treatable, proper etiologic diagnosis should be established. When anemia is non-regenerative, it can be caused by aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, bone marrow infiltration or hematopoietic factors deficiencies. Another possible cause is Pearson's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease that causes non-regenerative anemia associated with other cytopenias, pancreatic insufficiency, lactic acidosis and great variability in clinical presentation conditioned by heteroplasmy. It is characteristic to find in bone marrow studies variable vacuolization in erythroblastic progenitors and ring sideroblasts. The diagnosis is established by genetic study of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid performed by Southern blot analysis (complete mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid amplification by polymerase chain reaction -long), obtaining 70-80% deletion of 4977 bp (NMD 8343-13459). There is no curative therapy and support treatment is the only available nowadays. Death is frequent in early years of life.",0,1090
599,"BACKGROUND: Aorto-enteric fistula is a rare and potentially lethal entity. Its presentation may be as an enteric-paraprosthetic fistula, due to injury in the gut caused by direct contact with the vascular prosthesis. OBJECTIVE: We report a case of enteric-paraprosthetic fistulae with the unusual finding of Candida parapsilosis as the only isolated pathogen. CLINICAL CASE: A 65-year-old male, smoker, with aortobifemoral revascularisation with dacron due to aortoiliac occlusive disease, and re-intervention for thrombosis of left arm at 6 months. Hospitalisation at 22 months was required due to a toxic syndrome, which was diagnosed as enteric-paraprosthetic fistulae after complementary studies. The graft was removed and an extra-anatomic revascularisation was performed. Microbiology specimens taken from the duodenal segment in contact with the prosthesis showed the prosthetic segment and peri-prosthetic fluid were positive to C. parapsilosis. DISCUSSION: The finding of C. parapsilosis in all cultures taken during surgery, along with negative blood cultures and no other known sources of infection, is of interest. It is an unusual pathogen with low virulence and limited as regards other Candida species. Our patient had no clinical data common to cases of infection with C. parapsilosis, and the mechanism of graft infection is unknown. CONCLUSION: Graft infection by C. parapsilosis may be anecdotal. However, its consequences can also be severe. Microbiological tests can be useful to adjust antimicrobial therapy in the post-operative period, but their usefulness for determining the aetiology is doubtful, as it may be just an incidental finding.",0,1664

Sin embargo, hay pocos reportes acerca de la experiencia con su empleo en la actividad electrica sin pulso no traumatica. Describimos el caso de una paciente obstetrica exanguinada por sangrado masivo transoperatorio, en la que se realizo una TDU con un resultado optimo para la vida y la funcion neurologica. Adicionalmente, evaluamos la literatura correspondiente al tema, que en lo mejor de nuestro conocimiento es critica para expandir los protocolos de abordaje del ritmo de paro cardiaco no traumatico en los hospitales de alto volumen. Instituted under objective recommendations, Emergency Department Thoracotomy (EDT) has been described as a life-saving surgical maneuver in trauma patients arriving ""in extremis."" Nevertheless, there are few reports related to the experience regarding the use of the procedure in non-traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest. We describe the case of an obstetric patient exsanguinated by operative massive bleeding, where EDT was instituted reaching an optimal result for the survival and neurologic function. Additionally, we evaluate the literature related to this issue, which to the best of our knowledge, is critical to expand protocols of approach in non-traumatic cardiac arrest rhythm in high-volume hospitals.",0,1455
601,"INTRODUCTION: Polyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing vasculitis that mainly affects small and medium-sized arteries in skin and internal organs. Neurological involvement is reported in around 25% of cases: ischemic stroke is relatively common, but haemorrhagic lesions are extremely rare. Subarachnoid haemorrhage in polyarteritis nodosa is an uncommon expression of this disease, mostly associated with aneurism rupture. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is just one published case in pediatric age with polyarteritis nodosa and subarachnoid haemorrhage with no underlying aneurismal disease. CASE REPORT: A 7-year-old girl, who presented a non-aneurismal subarachnoid haemorrhage with intraparenchymal extension in the left basal ganglia. She was previously diagnosed with polyarteritis nodosa and prothrombotic condition, being under immunosuppressive and anti-platelet treatment at that moment. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of polyarteritis nodosa together with continued anti-platelet therapy to prevent thromboembolic disease in this patient could have predisposed to the haemorrhagic event in the process of cerebral vasculitis. Standard subarachnoid haemorrhage management is initially required in such cases as cerebral aneurysms are the most common cause of haemorrhage in the context of polyarteritis nodosa disease.",0,1343

The diagnosis was suspected by computed tomography with intravenous contrast and by magnetic resonance imaging and it was confirmed by arteriography of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. The treatment received was endovascular, although the other valid option for the treatment of this disease is the surgical resection. The objective of this communication is to present a case of acute pancreatitis due to arteriovenous malformation treated by endovascular approach.",0,592
603,"INTRODUCTION: Hirayama disease is a rare children's muscular atrophy that affects young Asian males, with muscular atrophy usually in one of the upper limbs that progresses slowly and later stabilises. It is diagnosed by means of electromyographic/electroneurographic with conduction speed studies (EMG/ENG-CS) and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord in a neutral position and with cervical flexion. Treatment is based on the cervical collar and surgery (severe cases). Very few studies have been conducted on patients at the paediatric age. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 7-year-old girl with atrophy of the muscles of the left hand and forearm, and a disease history of two years. The EMG/ENG-CS scans presented signs of very severe chronic denervation in the myotomes of C7, C8 and T1 on the left side, with conservation of the amplitudes of sensory evoked potentials, consistent with cervical myelopathy. Results of an MRI scan of the cervical spinal cord in a neutral position were normal at that level. Later, owing to suspicions pointing towards Hirayama disease, a new MRI scan of the cervical spinal cord was performed in a neutral position and in flexion. This second scan showed asymmetry in the size and morphology of the anterior funiculi of the spinal cord at C6/C7, hypersignal in the homolateral anterior horn and ingurgitation of the posterior epidural venous plexus. With a diagnosis of Hirayama disease, treatment is started with a cervical collar in order to prevent the damage from getting worse. CONCLUSIONS: This case of Hirayama disease is peculiar due to its epidemiological characteristics and is presented here with the aim of making this entity more widely known in our milieu. If diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is effective, and the studies conducted on children at the paediatric age are reviewed.",0,1860
604,"CASE REPORT: We report a case of keratitis in a female contact lens wearer, who developed a deep corneal abscess. The culture of a corneal biopsy scraping was positive for multiresistant Fusarium solani. The patient has a complicated clinical course and failed to respond to local and systemic antifungal treatment, requiring eye enucleation. CONCLUSION: Fusarium keratitis may progress to severe endophthalmitis. Clinical suspicion is paramount in order to start antifungal therapy without delay. Therapy is complex due to the high resistance of this organism to usual antifungal drugs.",0,587
605,"There are increasingly more patients with prosthetic implants (orthopaedic prostheses, lumbar instruments, osteosynthesis material). In the last decade, infections caused by carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae have increased (bacteriaemia, abscesses, urinary tract infections...) with great difficulty in treatment and important associated comorbidity. We present the first case of infection of a lumbar instrumentation by Klebsiella pneumoniae producing carbapenemase D, OXA-48 type, and successfully treated.",0,514
606,"Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare and aggressive subtype of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, originally described in the oral cavity of male adults with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It is composed of neoplastic ceils which resemble immunoblasts but present immunophenotype distinctive of plasma cell and Epstein-Barr virus latent infection. In children, it is an even rarer disease. We present a case of oral plasmablastic lymphoma in a vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus-positive five-year-old child.",0,535
607,"Iso-Kikuchi syndrome, or congenital onychodysplasia of the index finger, is an uncommon condition characterized by total anonychia or dysplasia of the nail of the index finger. It is occasionally accompanied by underlying bone abnormalities and is rarely associated with other conditions. Although various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the pathophysiology of the syndrome, its etiology remains unknown. We report the cases of 3 pediatric patients (2 boys and 1 girl) with nail changes and bone abnormalities consistent with Iso-Kikuchi syndrome. We highlight the importance of recognizing this entity early to avoid the need for additional tests and unnecessary treatment.",0,686
608,"The coexistence of two or more tumours in the same patient is unusual, but even rarer is the metastasis of one tumour to another. Most reports are based on evidence from autopsies; very few refer to surgical specimens. The most common primary tumour is pulmonary carcinoma and most frequent metastatic tumour is renal clear cell carcinoma. We present the case of a 54 year-old female with a past history of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast with metastases in lung, lymph nodes and bone. Three months previously to her referral to us, she had developed a renal mass and underwent nephrectomy. Histopathology revealed a renal chromophobe cell carcinoma with intratumoral breast cancer metastasis. We describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features and review the recent literature.",0,817
609,"We report the case of a 16 year old female who underwent left radical nephrectomy for a 13.2 cm neuroectodermic renal tumor and posterior chemo and radiotherapy in the Quiron Hospitals in Madrid and Complejo Hospitalario de Toledo, with a current survival of 14 months. Medical literature was reviewed for the historical, clinical, etiopathogenic, diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and survival features. We estimate the number of published cases to date. We also address the treatment performed and its results under a critical view.",0,536
610,"Primary colorectal lymphoma is a rare form of presentation of gastrointestinal tract lymphomas. Inflammatory bowel disease and its treatment are risk factors for its development. We report a 47-year-old male patient with Ulcerative Colitis of two years of evolution, treated initially with azathioprine and later on with infliximab. Due to a relapse in symptoms after the second dose of infliximab, a new coloncoscopy was performed showing a rectal ulcerative lesion, corresponding to a large cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The patient was successfully treated with RCHOP chemotherapy (Rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone). He is currently in disease remission.",0,685
611,"UNLABELLED: Patients with Benign Prostatic Obstruction (BPO) and Myasthenia Gravis (MG) treated with Transurethral Resection of the prostate (TURP) show a high incidence of urinary incontinence due to unnoticed damage to muscle fibres of the external sphincter. Photoselective laser vaporization could be an alternative treatment based on the hypothesis that using Laser as energy source in the treatment of BPH prevents sphincter damage because the energy is not transmitted outside the fiber tip. METHODS: We report the case of a man diagnosed of MG and symptomatic BPO treated satisfactorily with photoselective laser vaporization (GreenLight-XPS). RESULTS: Patient did not experienced postoperative secondary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Laser photoselective vaporization (GreenLight-XPS) could be the standard treatment for men with MG and BPO, whose prostate volume is less than 60 cc who are candidates for surgical treatment. Despite the extremely low incidence of these cases, further investigations are needed to confirm this affirmation.",0,1046
612,"Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease affecting sodium ion channels. It is characterised by right bundle branch block and ST elevation in the right precordial leads, and with no structural cardiac abnormalities. It is associated with sudden death. This disease may be unmasked by certain drugs and sudden changes in autonomic tone. Local anaesthetics may increase ECG changes due to a blockade of the sodium channels, mainly depending on the dose and the type of anaesthetic. Thus, there have been reported electrocardiographic changes consistent with Brugada syndrome, triggered after epidural or paravertebral infusion of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. The case is described of a 66 years old man, scheduled for inguinal herniorrhaphy as an outpatient. He had no history of syncope or arrhythmias. After spinal anaesthesia with 40mg of prilocaine the ECG showed ST elevation>2mm, and right bundle branch block in V1-V3.",0,939
613,"The description of the Bednar's ulcer is uncommon in the current literature. It has been associated with the traumatic effect of the bottle's nipple and/or no orthodontic soothers while breastfeeding. We present a newborn of 20 days of life attended at the emergency room for irritability, with the only finding on physical examination of two oral ulcers. We describe the clinical presentation, evolution and treatment. The normality of the diagnostic test, clinical characteristics and evolution lead to the diagnosis of Bednar s ulcer.",0,537
614,"Tumor lysis syndrome (SLT) is a rare and potentially fatal entity. It represents an oncological emergency. It can be diagnosed by its clinical presentation and also by laboratory results. In most cases it is presented as a complication of the chemotherapeutic treatment of oncohematological diseases with large tumor mass. Less frequently, a syndrome of spontaneous tumor lysis has been described, or secondary to the use of corticosteroids, hydroxyurea and radiotherapy. In its most severe forms it may require hospitalization in intensive care units and invasive therapeutic measures such as hemodialysis. We report four cases of SLT with unusual presentation characteristics admitted to our Medical Research Institute.",0,721
615,"Guillain-Barre syndrome is defined as an acute polyradiculoneuropathy, with sudden onset and its origin being mostly autoimmune. It is characterized by flaccid paralysis, symmetrical and ascending, together with areflexia, with or without sensory disturbances. It is the primary cause of acute flaccid paralysis in previously healthy children. Guillain-Barre syndrome presents different variants as part of the same spectrum. One of this is the Bickerstaff syndrome, characterized by ataxia, encephalopathy, hyperreflexia and external ophthalmoplegia. Early diagnosis is important with the view to establishing an early treatment that will be beneficial for those patients that progress to a more serious illness. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy who was previously healthy, and then presented symptoms that are compatible with Bickerstaff syndrome.",0,855
616,"CASE REPORT: A 20 year-old healthy patient consulted due to acute loss vision in his left eye. A fundus examination showed a macular alteration compatible with unifocal helioid choroiditis, characterized by being an atypical inflammatory yellow-white, round, single lesion of approximately an optic disc in diameter. The etiology study detected low Antitoxoplasma gondii Ig G (immunoglobulin) titers. DISCUSSION: The non-specificity of the serology and the atypical characteristics of the lesion is a limitation in the diagnosis. The Goldmann-Witmer coefficient may be useful in the diagnosis of atypical lesions, by comparing the concentration of IgG from the serum and aqueous humor.",0,685
617,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence supporting that neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory humoral mediated disorder associated with NMO-IgG/AQP-4 antibodies. However, little is known about the subsets of B cells and T cells that contribute to the pathogenesis or therapy response. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and immunological changes associated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IV-Igs) plus rituximab (RTX) in a patient with a severe acute attack of NMO and intrathecal synthesis of NMO-IgG/AQP-4, who previously did not respond to intravenous methylprednisolone and plasma exchange. METHODS: We sequentially analysed the levels of NMO-IgG/AQP-4 by immunohistochemistry, and B and T cells subsets by multiparametric flow-cytometry, in the CSF and peripheral blood (PB), before and alter IV-Igs plus RTX therapy. RESULTS: In the CSF before treatment, and compared with PB, there was a higher percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a lower percentage of CD8(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells. After therapy, the percentage of CD4(+) T cells remained high, and that of CD8(+) T cells increased. The observed decrease in the percentage of CD19(+) B cells was lower than in the PB. When the CSF was compared, it was found that the percentage of effector-memory and effector CD8(+) T cells had increased after therapy, and that of IgM memory B cells and switched-memory B cells decreased. The observed changes paralleled the decrease of NMO-IgG/AQP-4 results to negative and the clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that, besides intrathecal humoral immune response against AQP4, B and T cell subsets are involved in the modulation of inflammation within and outside the central nervous system.",0,1722
618,"We report a 51-year-old female who had a first episode of thrombocytopenia at 23 years of age during a pregnancy. At the age of fifty, a hysterectomy was indicated due to a metrorrhagia: a platelet count of 21,000/ul was detected. She was treated with eltrombopag with a good response. The family history of the patient revealed the presence of thrombocytopenia in several family members. Suspecting a hereditary thrombocytopenia, a genetic study revealed a mutation in the MYH-9 gene. This mutation can be suspected when there is a family history of thrombocytopenia with autosomal dominant inheritance, macrothrombocytopenia and in this particular case, due to the response to thrombopoietin receptor agonist, eltrombopag.",0,724
619,"A problem commonly undiagnosed, severe and diffi cult to treat is chronic compartment syndrome in athletes. This pathology in its acute phase requires a diagnosis and treatment early to avoid muscle necrosis and neurological injury. Also, in chronic cases, the diagnosis is mainly clinical and the complete liberation of all compartments of the leg is essential. I review the literature of management of this pathology and two cases with specific treatment are presented. The objective is to provide evidence-based guidance for both chronic and acute treatment of chronic compartment syndrome in athletes to reduce the delay in the diagnosis and implement effective therapeutic measures for the improvement of the athletes and to avoid as much as possible the presentation of complications and sequelae in this group of patients.",0,829
620,"Diencephalic syndrome is an infrequent cause of malnutrition. It is produced by a malfunctioning hypothalamus, and it is related to encephalic tumors. Patients present a serious and progressive weight loss although the appetite and calorie intake are, usually, adequate. Neurological symptoms typically have a late appearance, delaying diagnostic suspicion. We present a patient aged 2 years and a half with grade II chronic malnutrition, referred with presumptive diagnosis of celiac disease, with poor adherence and treatment failure. During hospitalization, diagnosis of diencephalic syndrome secondary to grade I pilocytic astrocytoma was reached.",0,651
621,"BACKGROUND: Attempts are being made in recent years to replace open surgery with endoscopic techniques in some obese patients when medical treatment fails, as they are considered to be less-invasive procedures. To date, there is little scientific evidence regarding their effectiveness. CLINICAL CASES: The cases are reported of 2 patients who attended our surgery looking for an effective bariatric surgical treatment after failed endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy after failure of an endoscopic technique does not offer great variation from the standard technique.",0,609
622,"Eyelid retraction, has received limited attention and it has passively been interpreted as the result of an overactive levator palpebrae superioris muscle secondary to midbrain injury. However, eyelid retractions can occur in other neurological diseases, not directly related with the midbrain. We report three patients who developed eyelid retraction. One patient had a bilateral eyelid retraction, related with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Another patient had a unilateral right eyelid retraction associated with a thalamic-mesencephalic infarct. The third patient had a bilateral pontine infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. In the patient with CJD, eyelid retraction did not subside. Among patients with infarctions, the retraction persisted after focal symptoms had subsided, showing an evolution that was apparently independent of the basic process. The analysis of these patients allows us to conclude that the pathogenesis of eyelid retraction includes supranuclear mechanisms in both the development and maintenance of the phenomenon. Unilateral or bilateral eyelid retraction does not alter the normal function of eyelid, which ever had normal close eye blink. In these reported cases, a hyperactivity of levator palpebrae superioris muscle was clinically ruled out.",0,1285
623,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of lung adenocarcinoma for which the first clinical manifestation was an iris metastasis. CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old male patient came for consultation referring a <<pinkish speck>> on his right eye. On biomicroscopy examination, a mass was found on the iris of the right eye. Subsequent systemic work-up of the patient revealed a left lung adenocarcinoma.

625,"The Austrian syndrome is a pathology caused by disseminated Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and characterized for the triad of pneumonia, endocarditis and meningitis. It has an estimated incidence of 0.9-7.8 cases per ten millions people each year, and a mortality of 32%. Alcohol abuse, as the main risk factor, appears only in four out of ten patients. Moreover, 14% of patientes do not have any risk factor. Two out of three patients are males and it occurs in the middle aged of life. It is more frequently on native valve, aortic valve is injured in the half of the cases. Severe regurgitation occurs in two per three patients. Appropriate antimicrobial treatment and early endocarditis surgery decrease mortality. It is possible that Austrian syndrome epidemiology is changing by the introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine in the children s calendar.",0,878

627,"INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy associated with gluten ingestion. In extended families of celiac patients that live in close proximity of one another, shared genetic and environmental factors can predispose them to CD. AIM: The aim of this study was to provide evidence about the genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of CD in the extended family of a pediatric patient. METHODS: The medical history, environmental conditions, and participant weight, height, and peripheral blood samples were evaluated. The HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were genotyped through qPCR testing and the IgA anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibodies were quantified using the ELISA test. RESULTS: Twelve close-living maternal relatives of the index case participated in the study. Eight of them presented with the HLA-DQ2 haplotype, inherited from the grandfather, and 7/12 and 9/12 were positive for IgA anti-gliadin and IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies, respectively. The main intestinal symptoms stated by the participants were abdominal bloating, excess flatulence, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux. The most frequent extra-intestinal symptoms were fatigue, stress, and anxiety. In addition, 6/13 participants had bronchial asthma. CONCLUSION: The extended family living in close proximity of one another shared a genetic predisposition, environmental conditions, and asthma, which could have predisposed them to celiac disease.",0,1479
629,"Two cases of insidious bacteremia by uncommon curve and spiral-shaped, motile anaerobic gram-negative rods are presented. Both of them were of an unclear origin and occurred in immunosuppressed patients with simultaneous diseases. The key tests for the identification of Anaerobiospirillum were its micromorphology, a strictly anaerobic condition, negative catalase activity, the special-potency disk profile, glucose fermentation, and beta-NAG production. Desulfovibrio species was identified by all the above preliminary tests but with a different disk profile, as well as for being asaccharolytic and desulfoviridin and H2S producer. We here alert about the resistance or intermediate susceptibility of Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens against antimicrobial agents, such as metronidazole, one of the first-line drugs used for the treatment of anaerobic gram-negative infections. Aminopenicillins with beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations and imipenem were active for this agent. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was beta-lactamase producer and resistant to cephalosporins, while metronidazole, imipenem and levofloxacin were active. A reliable identification of these microorganisms is important for establishing the best therapeutic scheme.",0,1245

631,"Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed otorhinolaryngological procedures on children. The postoperative complications are classified into primary or intermediate, which generally appear within 24h, and as secondary or delayed, after 48 h. We present the case of an ischemic stroke after performing a tonsillectomy on a 3 year-old boy, which was diagnosed in the immediate postoperative period. Using brain echo-doppler and angio-CT, an intraluminal clot was observed in the left internal carotid artery, probably as a result of direct vessel injury during arterial ligature for hemostasis.",0,604
632,"Trichoblastoma is a benign cutaneous neoplasm that is clinically and histologically similar to basal cell carcinoma. We report the dermoscopic features seen in 2 cases of facial trichoblastoma. One case presented with very short, delicate, scarcely branching telangiectases against a pearly white background. In the second case, the veins were also short and scarcely branching, but they were arranged in a crown pattern, with white striae and milia-like cysts. Although dermoscopic evidence of fine, scarcely branching telangiectases is not specific to a diagnosis of trichoblastoma, these features may be useful for differentiating this neoplasm from nodular basal cell carcinoma.",0,682
633,"BACKGROUND: The peripheral nerve injuries are devastating for the patient; the classic reconstructive options are the Nerve Graft and Tendon Transfers. Lately the Nerve Transfers are being used more and more broadly. They are an excellent option on early injuries and when the motor plate is still alive. The advantages are numerous, because the functional recovery is much better. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the case of a patient who sustained and injury on the median and ulnar nerve, so the EDQ and ECU branches were used to restore the Ulnar Intrinsic Function. The 4-year follow-up showed good results. CONCLUSION: The ulnar intrinsic innervations provide dexterity; fine motor function and pinch, which is essential for a functioning hand. The most popular donor to restore the function of the motor branch of the ulnar nerve is the anterior interosseous nerve. When this is unavailable the use of the redundant branches of the EDQ and ECU must be considered.",0,969
634,"INTRODUCTION: Tuberous sclerosis is a rare multisystemic disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. There are few documented cases in the literature of retinal hamartomas (astrocytomas) with aggressive progression in the context of this disease. CASE REPORT: A report is presented on a case of a 31 year-old male with unknown history of ophthalmic or systemic conditions, who referred to a history of 6 months of blurred vision in his right eye. This was caused by a unilateral retinal hamartoma due to an undiagnosed tuberous sclerosis. DISCUSSION: Multidisciplinary management, with the cooperation of Internal Medicine and the Oncology Department, is needed in these cases, as well as genetic counselling for affected patients. Complications are directly related to increased tumour size. Treatment does not seem to have any influence on the natural history of the disease.",0,889
635,"OBJECTIVE: Update of clear cell (tubulo) papillary renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: We provide the only three cases described to date in our hospital. RESULTS: One of the new entities of epithelial renal tumors incorporated by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) in 2013 was the clear cell (tubulo) papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCCtpcc). Although initially was described under other nomenclatures, it was not until 2013 that it was clearly defined. CONCLUSION: The RCCtpcc is usually a low grade and stage subtype of epithelial RCC. It predominates in the sixth decade of life, although cases have already been described in children and young adults. It has a typical immunohistochemical pattern with positive CK7, vimentine, VT and smooth muscle antigen, and negative CD10. They usually have a low malignant potential.",0,841
636,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, clinically aggressive hematologic malignancy that most commonly manifests as cutaneous lesions with or without bone marrow involvement and leukemic dissemination. The demonstration of tumor cells with the characteristic immunophenotype with expression of CD56, generally CD4 and dendritic cell antigens (CD123, cyTCL-1, HLA-DR), in the absence of myeloid or lymphoid lineage markers is required for the diagnosis. Responses to chemotherapy are initially satisfactory, with frequent systemic and central nervous system relapses. We report a 24 year-old male with BPDCN, initially diagnosed and treated as non-Hodgkin CD4+ T-cell lymphoma, with initial complete remission who evolved with early central nervous system relapse. A second attempt of chemotherapy failed and the patient died two months later.",0,867
637,"BACKGROUND: Ninety confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. We report the details of a second family cluster of MERS-CoV infections from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological details of 3 patients from a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections. RESULTS: The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV acquisition from unrecognized mild or asymptomatic cases may be a more important contributor to ongoing transmission than previously appreciated.",1,1342
638,"BACKGROUND: Crossed renal ectopia is a rare pathology that is often asymptomatic. Intraoperative detection with a sigma complicated neoplasia is more infrequent and requires correct management to avoid a renal ureteral injury. AIM: To present a case report of a patient with a sigma complicated neoplasia and a crossed renal ectopia detected incidentally. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 62-year-old man that was submitted for emergency surgery for a sigma perforated neoplasm, and who presented with a previously undiagnosed left-side CRE. During surgery there was a need to insert 2-double-J stents as a guide to both ureters and to avoid any injury to them. DISCUSSION: Crossed renal ectopia is a rare, often asymptomatic entity, the diagnosis of which is usually incidental. In our case, the detection of a concomitant complicated neoplasm, required identification of both ureters due the anatomic doubt of its localization and to avoid them being injured. In conclusion, upon finding a casual crossed renal ectopia during an emergency surgery of sigma, we recommend the identification of the ureters to facilitate its location and to avoid any injury to the ureters.",0,1177
639,"INTRODUCTION: Cloverleaf skull syndrome, or Kleeblattschadel syndrome, is a rare malformation in which the skull has a cloverleaf appearance. It is caused by the premature closure of several sutures, being evident before birth. OBJECTIVE: To present our experience in a case of cloverleaf skull syndrome, and update the information from the literature. CLINICAL CASE: A female infant of 5 months of age, diagnosed at birth with cleft lip and palate and hydrocephaly. A peritoneal ventricle valve was implanted at 30 days of life, and an ocular enucleation was performed due to an infectious process. The patient was followed-up in Genetics, where it confirmed a macrocephaly and craniosynostosis type cloverleaf skull. The 46XX cytogenetic study and echocardiography were normal. The brain CT scan showed multiple anomalies associated with hydrocephaly and non-specific malformations. CONCLUSION: Cloverleaf skull may be present in isolated form or associated with other congenital abnormalities, leading to various craniosynostosis syndromes, such as Crouzon, Pfeiffer or Carpenter. It may also be a component of the amniotic rupture sequence or to different dysplasias, such as campomelic dysplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia type 2, or the asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy of Jeune. The case presented does not fulfil all the characteristics needed to be included within a specific syndrome, and on not having a family history that suggests a hereditary pattern or chromosome abnormalities, it is concluded that it is a case of a congenital anomaly of sporadic presentation.",0,1574
640,"INTRODUCTION: The antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired autoimmune thrombophilia, characterized by arterial and/or venous thrombosis. Rarely, this condition can have a catastrophic presenta tion, with high mortality, and presence of microangiopathy and involvement of three or more organs. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation and evolution of a pediatric patient with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, with a seronegative onset form, whose response to aggressive therapy was favorable. CLINICAL CASE: Adolescent female, with a one-week history of pain, increased abdo minal volume and edema in the lower extremities. Generalized lupus erythematosus was diagnosed and the neoplastic process was ruled out. During its evolution, she presented various thrombotic events, initially with the presence of negative antiphospholipid antibodies, which were subsequently positive. The patient presented multisystemic failure secondary to multiorgan thrombosis, required hemodynamic and ventilatory support. It was managed with low molecular weight heparin, plas mapheresis, anticoagulation, immunosuppression and boluses of rituximab with excellent response. CONCLUSIONS: We consider this case interesting because it is an infrequent diagnosis in the pediatric age and whose suspicion, timely and aggressive intensive management, can change the poor progno sis and high mortality of these patients.",0,1410
641,"INTRODUCTION: Trisomy 9 is an unusual chromosome abnormality in live-born patients, which is frequently accompanied by functional and structural anomalies of the central nervous system. Among many other alterations, several studies have been published in the English-speaking literature that show an association between chromosome 9 abnormality and pathologies affecting the choroid plexuses. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 4-month-old male with trisomy 9 mosaicism associated to hydrocephalus secondary to choroid plexus hyperplasia, who was referred due to a clinical picture of intracranial hypertension. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage procedure that was initially chosen caused massive ascites due to an excessive production of CSF, and led to a cascade of multiple surgical interventions, which included endoscopic and drainage procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This is another example of an association between choroid plexus pathologies and chromosome 9 abnormality. Due to its scarce incidence, diagnosis of hydrocephalus secondary to plexus hyperplasia is difficult, as is selecting its most suitable treatment. In this type of hydrocephalus there is a double pathophysiological mechanism, which involves an increase in CSF production and a decrease in its reabsorption. Despite taking these considerations into account, the treatment of hydrocephalus secondary to plexus hyperplasia is a real challenge that usually leads to multiple surgical interventions ranging from plexectomy or coagulation of the choroid plexuses to the implantation of CSF drainage devices.",0,1579
642,"Laryngeal granulomas are benign lesions located in the posterior third of the glottis, mainly at the level of the vocal apophysis of the arytenoid cartilage. They are typically associated with three etiological factors: endotracheal intubation, inappropriate voice use and/or gastroesophageal reflux. The formation of a post-intubation laryngeal granuloma is a late complication related to intubation injury. It is uncommon in the child, especially if the period of intubation is short. It is usually unilateral and produces dysphonia, pharyngeal foreign body sensation and cough. Treatment consists of surgical removal when the lesion is pediculated or causes respiratory compromise. We present a 14-year-old girl who developed a pediculated laryngeal granuloma after orotracheal intubation of less than 24 hours, which was evidenced 3 months after cardiac surgery. We describe the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of this pathology.",0,964
643,"INTRODUCTION: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a rare childhood disease. The development of PTC in dyshormonogenetic congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is infrequent, with very few case reports in literature. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of PTC in a boy with dyshormonogenetic CH without goitre and exposed to ionising radiation. To evaluate relationships between these factors and development of PTC. CASE REPORT: We present a boy with dyshormonogenetic CH since birth. Early hormonal substitution was initiated, with subsequent normal levels of thyrotropin and thyroid hormones. He has also congenital cardiomyopathy, exposed to interventional treatment with 10 heart catheterisations, and approximately 26 chest X-rays at paediatric doses. A thyroid nodule was found in thyroid echography at the age of 6 years old. Fine needle aspiration biopsy confirmed high probability of thyroid carcinoma (Bethesda 5). The pre-surgical thorax and cerebral scan showed no evidence of metastasis. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy. Pathological examination revealed a 0.5cm papillary thyroid micro-carcinoma in the right lobe, with no evidence of dissemination. CONCLUSION: Genetic mutations and radiation exposure may play an important role in the development of PTC. There may be common pathways between dyshormonogenetic CH and thyroid carcinoma that need further investigation.",0,1378
644,"A 68-year old man diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presented with multiple pneumonic infiltrations on his chest X-ray, and the patient was placed on a mechanical ventilator because of progressive respiratory failure. Urinary protein excretion steadily increased for a microalbumin to creatinine ratio of 538.4 mg/g Cr and a protein to creatinine ratio of 3,025.8 mg/g Cr. The isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable serum creatinine level increased to 3.0 mg/dL. We performed a kidney biopsy 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Acute tubular necrosis was the main finding, and proteinaceous cast formation and acute tubulointerstitial nephritis were found. There were no electron dense deposits observed with electron microscopy. We could not verify the virus itself by in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy (MERS-CoV co-stained with dipeptidyl peptidase 4). The viremic status, urinary virus excretion, and timely kidney biopsy results should be investigated with thorough precautions to reveal the direct effects of MERS-CoV with respect to renal complications.",1,1115
645,"Trichomycosis is a superficial infection caused by Corynebacterium flavescens, which regularly affects axillary, and to a a lesser extent, pubic, scrotal and intergluteal, and exceptionally, head hairs or trichomycosis capitis (TC). This condition is characterised by the formation of bacterial nodules. Clinically, it can be confused with white piedra or pediculosis. The diagnosis is made by microscopic and dermoscopic observation and confirmed by culture. OBJECTIVE: To present a case of TC in an infant and illustrate the microscopic, dermoscopic, and ultrastructural characteristics. CLINICAL CASE: A 6 month-old boy, otherwise healthy, with multiple yellowish concretions on the hairs of the head. TC was confirmed by yellow fluorescence with Woods light; white-yellowish beads, like rosaries of crystalline stones were observed on dermoscopy, direct examination showed bacterial masses, and Corynebacterium flavescens was identified by culture. A superficial infection, without perforation of the hairs, was confirmed by electron microscopy. Treatment with fusidic acid for 3 weeks achieved a clinical and microbiological cure. CONCLUSION: TC is a rare condition that affects children, and tends to be mistaken for other diseases of the hair, such as pediculosis and mycotic infections.",0,1294
646,"BACKGROUND: Osteochondromas are benign bony tumours, with only 1 to 4% being located in the spine. It occurs more frequently in the cervical spine, with C2 being the vertebra most affected. The neurological presentation is slow due to the growth characteristics of the tumour. Computed axial tomography is the reference method for diagnosis. Surgical management is indicated for patients with neurological impairment or pain. CLINICAL CASE: The first case presents a 21-year-old male with osteochondroma located in the spinous processes of L2, L3 and L4. The second case is a 20-year-old female with multiple osteochondromatosis with tumours at the right lateral mass of C1, with extension to C2 and tumours on the spinous processes of C5 and C7. Both patients presented with painful symptoms, which were resolved after surgical resection of the tumours. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of these conditions, relevance of a clinical-radiographic diagnosis, and considerations required for surgical treatment are discussed here.",0,1018
647,"Benign notochordal cell tumors (TBCN) are lesions with notochordal differentiation which affect the axial skeleton. They are characterized by asymptomatic or non-specific symptomatology and are radiologically unnoticed because of their small size, or because they are mistaken with other benign bone lesions, such as vertebral hemangiomas. When they are large, or symptomatic, can be differential diagnosis with metastases, primary bone tumors and chordomas. We present a case of a TBCN in a 50-year-old woman, with a sacral lesion seen in MRI. A CT-guided biopsy was scheduled to analyze the lesion, finding that the tumor was not clearly recognizable on CT, so the anatomical references of MRI were used to select the appropriate plane. The planning of the approach and the radio-pathological correlation were determinant to reach the definitive diagnosis.",0,858
648,"Not only ae cardiac hibernomas rare, ante-mortem diagnosis is poor, due to the clinical and radiological similarity with other intracardiac masses. Furthermore, cardiac hibernomas can be asymptomatic and thus escape detection with imaging studies. We present a case of an 81-year-old woman who died as a result of pulmonary tumor embolism. This unusual case highlights the necessity for clinicians and pathologists to be familiar with intra-cardiac neoplasms. We discuss its diagnostic difficulty and the complication of pulmonary tumor embolism.",0,546
649,"Two cases of bacteremia caused by Helicobacter cinaedi are presented. The first case was diagnosed in a 76-year-old male patient, and was secondary to a vascular access device placement; the second case corresponded to a febrile infant of 37 days of life, and was associated with acute gastroenteritis. H. cinaedi is a microorganism difficult to grow in different culture media and also to identify to species level. In both cases, the microscopic observation of blood culture bottles, the use of mass spectrometry and the subsequent sequencing of the hsp60 gene were essential. In the recent literature, H. cinaedi infections are being reported more frequently. In this report we present the first documented cases of bacteremia caused by H. cinaedi in Argentina.",0,764
650,"Sarcoidosis of lacrimal sac is a very uncommon disease. When the patient has symptoms of lacrimal sac diseases, it is necessary to take into account the histological evaluation, to demonstrate the involvement of the lacrimal sac by this pathology. In patients with sarcoidosis history, the treatment is surgical and it is suggested to do an external dacryocystorhinostomy, in order to take a biopsy, to get a diagnosis and to establish the incidence of this pathology. The case is presented of a 44 year-old female, with a history of sarcoidosis lymph nodes, who presented with a right chronic dacryocystitis of one year onset.",0,627
651,"We present the case of a 94 years- old patient, which was operated 14 years ago of a right total knee replacement for osteoarthritis, actually she suffers of pain and instability; her X ray shown polyethylene wear without loosening of the metal components. The polyethylene insert is not manufactured anymore so we decided cement a new polyethylene insert on the native tibial baseplate. The two years follow up show us a patient asymptomatic, good function and no radiolucencies on the tibial component. We only found a similar case report in Madrid and we believed that this decision, taken from total hip revisions, will succeed.",0,632
652,"Knee pain is one of the most frequent musculoskeletal symptoms in young physically active males. Common entities of clinical diagnosis as osteochondritis/apophysitis and others that need complementary studies should be considered in the differential diagnosis. We present the case of a 12-year-old male athlete with continuous pain in his right knee that intensifies with physical activity and with direct pressure. Diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease is made by exploratory data, pain-to-finger palpation on the anterior tibial tuberosity, and is confirmed by radiology. This entity is described as well as the main pathologies derived from overuse to make differential diagnosis and to stress preventive measures regarding a correct orientation in the sport activity.",0,771
653,"Chylous ascites is the presence of lymph from the thorax or bowel in the abdominal cavity. In Western countries, the most common causes of chylous ascites in adults are tumors, cirrhosis, and postoperative leakage, whereas the most common causes in children are congenital lymphatic anomalies and trauma. By contrast, in developing countries, infectious causes are responsible for most cases of chylous ascites. We present a case of chylous ascites secondary to acute necrotizing pancreatitis refractory to conservative treatment that was definitively resolved after intranodal lymphangiography with lipiodol. This is a safe and efficacious minimally invasive treatment for lymphatic leakage.",0,692
654,"Anti-p200 pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by the presence of circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against laminin gamma-1, a 200-kDa protein located in the lamina lucida of the basement membrane. We review the clinical, histopathological and immunological characteristics of the first 2 cases described in Spain. Anti-p200 pemphigoid shares histopathological and immunopathological findings with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, the main entity in the differential diagnosis. However, its management follows the same guidelines as those used for bullous pemphigoid. The diagnosis is confirmed by immunoblotting, which is a complex technique available in few centers. We propose the immunohistochemical detection of collagen type IV on the floor of the blister, combined with standard immunofluorescence techniques, as a simple, accessible alternative to differentiate anti-p200 pemphigoid from epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.",0,984
655,"For 11 years, a 38-year-old male residing in a subtropical region of Ecuador, was repeatedly diagnosed with chronic anemia, and treated with blood transfusions in a hospital of province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador. He was transferred to Quito for severe anemia, having hemoglobin of 4 g/dL. Duodenoscopy was performed and adult nematodes, identified later as Ancylostoma duodenale, were observed. The patient was successfully treated with albendazole for five consecutive days and given blood transfusions. In the control visit at eight months, without anemia and no hookworm ova in the stool examined were found.",0,606
656,"CASE REPORT: Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) is a variant of multifocal choroiditis that principally affects young and healthy women. A case of this condition is described in a woman who presented with a scotoma as the main complaint. Four months after the diagnosis of PIC, she developed an exudative neurosensory detachment associated with an active focus of juxtafoveal choroiditis. Finally, with systemic corticosteroids and intravitreal ranibizumab, she made excellent progress. DISCUSSION: Intravitreal ranibizumab, associated with systemic corticosteroids, may be an effective treatment for exudative neurosensory detachment complicating PIC.",0,652

658,"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy, and is characterized by frequent and difficult to treat seizures associated with mental retardation. The case is presented of a 21 year-old male with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with bilateral cervical facet joint dislocation fracture at C6-C7 and spinal canal compression as a result of a fall during a seizure. In this case the management of the difficult airway expected in an awake and uncooperative patient, with cervical spinal cord injury is described. An airway management strategy was proposed, that allowed a rapid and safe airway control with the best possible tolerance and maintaining the neck immobilised, so as not to increase neurological injury. Within this strategy, plan A was defined as inhalation induction with sevoflurane to maintain spontaneous breathing and tracheal intubation with Airtraq(R). We believe that the Airtraq(R) video laryngoscope with inhalational induction with sevoflurane is a valid and effective alternative in the management of expected difficult airway.",0,1061
659,"BACKGROUND: Mesenteric lymphangioma are rare tumours. They usually present early on in life, if congenital, or soon after trauma. The usual sites of presentation of lymphangiomas are in the neck, and axillae. In the abdomen they are more common in the mesentery, primarily of the ileum, or retroperitoneal. OBJECTIVE: A rare case is presented of a mesenteric lymphangioma. CLINICAL CASE: It involves an elderly African-American male, many years after trauma, and characterised with early satiety, causing weight loss, but without gastric outlet obstruction or vomiting. Its diagnosis, management and review of literature are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenteric cysts are rare tumours that should be included as differential diagnosis in elderly patients with a history of previous abdominal trauma.",0,797
660,"INTRODUCTION: Retinal astrocytic hamartoma is generally an asymptomatic benign tumour that may or may not be associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex. Haemorrhage is a rare presentation. CASE REPORT: The case concerns a 12-year-old patient with ""a black spot"" vision in the upper temporal hemifield of the right eye, who referred a similar episode 2 years ago. The anterior pole was normal in the slit lamp. A mass of translucent white-yellow peri-papillary appearance and vitreous peri-papillary haemorrhage was observed in funduscopy. The autofluorescence, fluorescence angiography, and optical coherence tomography characteristics were all compatible with retinal astrocytic hamartoma. Complementary studies (serology and X-rays) and the complete clinical examination rule out associated systemic involvement. The patient was followed-up closely until the vitreous haemorrhage was reabsorbed. CONCLUSION: Vitreous haemorrhage is a rare complication of Retinal astrocytic hamartoma and funduscopic exploration is difficult. Systemic involvement should be ruled out.",0,1073
661,"Gastric volvulus (GV) is characterized by the abnormal rotation of a portion of the stomach around a horizontal or vertical axis that can cause obstruction, vascular disorder and even strangulation, and may evolve into necrosis or even perforation. It can be classified according to its aetiology into primary or secondary GV, according to its anatomy into axial organ or into axial mesenteric GV, and according to its presentation into chronic or acute GV. Both types of volvulus require treatment; however, in spite of the classic treatment being open surgery, there is no standard treatment, nor is there consensus on the alternative of choice at present. Minimally invasion techniques, whether endoscopic or laparoscopic, should be considered in patients of advanced age or high surgical risk, where what is sought is a reduction in perioperative morbidity and mortality.",0,875
662,"CASES: Two cases are reported in which implantation of a collagen copolymer phakic intraocular lens (implantable collamer lens) corrected refractive errors in eyes with corneal scarring. A previous accident, in both cases, resulted in a central linear scar on the surface of the cornea of one eye. In the first patient, a corneal scar was visible in the left eye. The distance corrected visual acuity was 0.3 (-7.75 -4x160 degrees ). An uncorrected distance visual acuity of 0.25 was obtained by implanting an implantable collamer lens. In the second patient an oblique corneal scar was visible in the right eye. The distance corrected visual acuity was 0.25 (-8.75 -1.25x8 degrees ), and after implantation of the implantable collamer lens, uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.25. DISCUSSION: The indications of the implantable collamer lens should be reviewed and possibly expanded.",0,889

664,"OBJECTIVE: We report two cases of patients with a previous diagnosis of hematologic tumor who present with testicular recurrence, and we carry out a review of the literature regarding the infrequency of this pathology. METHODS: We present a retrospective review of the medical records of two patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma) with occurrence of relapse in the testicle. We reviewed the management and outcome after treatment with bilateral orchiectomy. RESULTS: Case 1: The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and treated with an allogeneic transplant. Two years later, the patient reported an increase in testicular size. The complementary studies lead us to suspect a testicular recurrence that was confirmed after orchiectomy. Currently, the patient awaits the start of a chemotherapy treatment prior to a new allogeneic transplant. Case 2: Patient with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma who started a polychemotherapy treatment without response and underwent allogeneic transplant. After five months with complete remission, there were signs of systemic recurrence, and a study for a new transplant was carried out. During the study, potential testicular recurrence was observed. After a batch of complementary tests, bilateral orchiectomy was performed and the diagnosis was confirmed. Currently, the patient is undergoing an allogeneic transplant protocol after radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Currently the mortality rate in cases of relapse of hematologic malignancy in the testicle has declined despite the sharp rise in its incidence. This is because of, as in our case, early diagnosis and the combined use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. This has been achieved through an interdisciplinary collaboration of urologists, hematologists, oncologists and radiotherapists.",0,1890

666,"OBJECTIVE: To present the case of simultaneous presentation of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and aged-related macular degeneration (AMD). CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old woman presented with decreased vision in the left eye (LE). In the examination there was an orange peripapillary lesion surrounded by lipid exudates and another subfoveal greyish lesion in the LE. Disciform scarring was observed in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography showed a classic neovascular membrane in in the LE fovea. Indocyanine angiography (ICGA) showed a polyp-like peri-papillary aneurysmal dilation in both eyes. The patient was treated with photodynamic therapy and anti-VEFG injections with stabilisation of the lesions. CONCLUSION: PCV and AMD can co-exist in unusual cases. When PCV is suspected, ICGA is mandatory for diagnosis.",0,825
667,"A 69 year old man was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from the Emergency Department due to severe respiratory failure. Due to unsuccessful non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation was performed. A category I ulcer in coccyx was detected 48h after admission. Eight hours later, a double erythema (the second one darker than the first one) with displacement between 30-45 degrees over the bony prominence suggested there was a deep tissue injury. The lesion progressed rapidly during the next 24h. The shape and the rapid evolution of the injury lead us to diagnose a Kennedy terminal ulcer (KTU). At 72h after the admission, and once the causes of acute decompensation were ruled out, limitation of life-sustaining treatment was decided. An individualised plan of care was drawn up with the aim of identifying problems in a patient with KTU evolving from a critical to a terminal situation. Our overall objectives (NOC) were to adapt the care plan based on a realistic approach. Nursing interventions (NIC) included actions such as pain management, conservative treatment of the injury, agony care and support to help the family to make decisions. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of KTU helped the health care team in the decision-making process when they considered limiting the life support, as well as in the adapting of the care plan to the actual situation.",0,1385
668,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious and life-threatening complication that occurs in five per cent of patients exposed to heparin. It should be considered in patients with a platelet count <100x10(9)cells/l or a >50% decrease from baseline count in association with heparin therapy. Thromboembolic complications develop in 50% of patients. Bleeding is rare as the platelet count nadir typically does not drop below 20x10(9)cells/l. Up to 12% of dialysis patients develop HIT, named haemodialysis-related-heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HD-HIT), as they are a risk group with continuous exposure to heparin. The definition of HD-HIT is less strict, in the range of a platelet count decrease of 30% and below 150x10(9)cells/l due to the intermittent use of heparin. Heparin cessation and alternative anticoagulation are the key interventions in patients with HIT. In dialysis patients, citrate anticoagulation, heparin-free dialysis or peritoneal dialysis are options that must be considered. The authors describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of five cases of HD-HIT, and emphasize the importance of an accurate diagnosis and early intervention in order to reduce the mortality risk, which can be as high as 20 per cent.",0,1259

676,"Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a bening pathology and it represents the most common form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is characterized by the presence of papules or firm nodules of a pinkish or yellow-brownish nature, which mainly compromise the skin and, exceptionally, other organs. It is a self-limited entity having a spontaneous regression during the first five years of life. We report the case of a one-month-old patient who presented a congenital tumor in the abdomen, whose histopathology showed the presence of multinucleated giant Touton cells, which are typical of this pathology. We emphasize the rare occurrence of this type of lesion and the importance of the multiple differential diagnosis to be taken into account due to the age of the patient and the characteristics of the lesion.",0,809
677,"Central venous cannulation is a commonly performed procedure in the hospital setting, while the internal jugular vein is one of the most frequently used to perform central venous access. The presence of venous valves in the jugular veins is a well-known fact, albeit often neglected during central venous cannulation. However, venous valves can make this procedure difficult, increasing the chance of developing complications. We report the case of a patient in whom the presence of a valve in the internal jugular vein did not permit a vascular access to be obtained through this vessel.",0,588
678,"INTRODUCTION: Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia is a pre-malignant lesion of the ocular surface. It can be treated with topical interferon alpha-2b (INF alpha-2b) as first choice. CLINICAL CASE: A 71-year-old man referred for corneal-conjunctival, gelatinous lesion in the left eye (LE) with an area of almost 270 degrees . The clinical diagnosis was compatible with a corneal-conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia. Topical treatment was started with INF alpha-2b at a dose of one million international units (IU)/ml, 4 times/day for 4 months, with remission being achieved. CONCLUSION: The isolated use of topical INF alpha-2b is an effective treatment as a first option in the case of corneal-conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia, positioning itself as a form of effective and safe treatment compared to other therapeutic options. Surgical excision and use of other chemotherapy agents could lead to severe limbic deficits and other side effects.",0,956
679,"INTRODUCTION: Guillain-Barre syndrome is classically defined as a symmetrical ascending acute polyradiculoneuropathy, although there are atypical variants that make diagnosis difficult. CASE REPORTS: The medical data of six patients in our hospital area are collected during the first quarter of 2013. Lumbar punctures, imaging, neurophysiological studies, ganglioside antibodies and serologies have been proposed in all cases. We focus on the atypical features as late hyporeflexia, increased frequency of asymmetry and distal paresis and initial fever. From a neurophysiological point of view, all patients presented sensorimotor axonal forms. The most consistent datas in early studies is the F wave's alteration. A Miller Fisher variant associated with faciocervicobraquial paresis and cerebral reversible vasoconstriction syndrome has been detected. A bilateral brachial paresis and lumbar polyradiculopathy in the context of influenza A infection is other interesting case. The saltatory variant with cranial nerve involvement and lower limbs paresis has been demonstrated in one patient. Bands in cerebrospinal fluid are positive in three cases and anti-ganglioside antibodies in one patient. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone may explain some of the hyponatremias registered. The first line of treatment are inmunoglobulins in all patients. Plasmapheresis exchanges has been used as an additional therapy in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: These clusters of six axonal cases with atypical clinical features justifies the need for knowledge of these variants in order to achieve an early treatment. Late hyporeflexia and brachialfaciocervico, saltatory and lumbar forms should be considered in the spectrum of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The etiological study should rule out a lots of pathogens as influenza A.",0,1838
680,"In patients with malformations and delayed psychomotor development it is important to discard chromosomopathies. Balanced reciprocal translocations are the most frequent chromosomopathies present in 1:500 live newborns. In general, carriers have normal phenotype, but they may have infertility, abortions or children with congenital malformations. The reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 9 can lead to offspring with monosomies and trisomies of these chromosomes. Short arm monosomy of chromosome 9 may present delayed psychomotor development, trigonocephaly, facial dysmorphia and genital abnormalities. We reviewed GTG karyotype records from our Institution to identify cases with chromosomes 2 and/or 9 alterations from 2005 to 2014. We describe two cases with monosomy 9p secondary to a translocation between chromosomes 2 and 9. The patients share features of monosomy 9p24-pter, however the genotypephenotype correlation is complex due to the extension of the involved segments. We emphasize the importance of chromosomal diagnosis to offer genetic assessment.",0,1081
681,"Pulmonary vascular disease in children is multifactorial and heterogeneous. While it shares some features with pulmonary hypertension in adults, there are differences in the associated comorbidities and conditions, the coexistence of genetic or developmental diseases. Interstitial lung diseases may be responsible for this entity. One is alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins, a rare pathology but with a mortality rate of 100%, characterized by a failure in the formation of lung tissue that eventually results in impaired gas diffusion. We present a 5-month-old patient studied due to suspected congenital heart disease with persistent hypoxemia; diagnosis was made through lung biopsy.",0,717

683,"Functional bundle branch block during a supraventricular tachycardia can be observed with shorter cycle lengths and represent a physiologic response by the specialized intraventricular conduction system to accelerated AV nodal conduction. The present case corresponds to a young patient with exercise induced orthodromic A-V reentrant tachycardia and alternating bundle branch block. This unusual response is explained by the finding obtained during the electrophysiology study. An accelerated AV nodal conduction made the depolarizing wave front reach the bundle branches during their refractory period. Once block in one bundle was stablished, block persisted due to the linking phenomenon that is repetitive retrograde concealed conduction from the contralateral bundle. After catheter ablation of a concealed left-sided accessory A-V pathway, rapid atrial pacing at the same cycle length of the tachycardia reproduced the same aberrancies observed during tachycardia. This response proved that functional bundle branch block is due to the short cycle length and not the presence of an accessory A-V pathway.",0,1111
684,"Pheochromocytoma is a tumour of the chromaffin tissue. It may, through catecholamine release, have deleterious effects on myocardial structure. A 48-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus (ASA II) was diagnosed of pheochromocytoma-induced myocarditis, which caused severe cardiogenic shock, with an ejection fraction of 20%. Extreme blood pressure swings required aggressive therapy with vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine and dopamine) and an intra-aortic balloon pump, despite which severe haemodynamic instability persisted. Finally, the use of magnesium sulphate allowed for cardiovascular stabilization and weaning off vasoactive drugs prior to surgery. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy helps not only to functionally confirm tumour tissue, but also to assess severity and prognosis of cardiac failure. Prognosis of pheochromocytoma-induced heart failure can be very poor. The use of these two well-known and relatively simple 'tools' for treatment and prognosis is a helpful option to keep in mind.",0,1050
685,"There is little information on the presence of the Mycobacterium avium-Intracellulare (MAC) complex in Peru. Five cases of MAC infection are described in patients with HIV/AIDS at the National Hospital Dos de Mayo, Lima - Peru. The patients presented, mainly, persistent fever, chronic diarrhea, consumptive syndrome, pancytopenia and citofagocitosis. In all of them, resistant acid-alcohol bacilli were identified in feces, so they received antituberculous treatment. The culture of feces was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, later, in all cases MAC was identified using a molecular test (genotype) in the culture of feces. Three patients received treatment for MAC right after identification; however, they all died. Before presentations similar to the reported, we suggest the use of higher performance methods (blood culture, myeloculture, molecular tests), as well as early associating drugs with activity for MAC to antitubercular scheme with the intention of improving the prognosis of this group of patients.",0,1028
686,"In many cases, numb chin syndrome (NCS) may represent a banal pathology. However, as it can be associated with malignant processes, its presence should alert the clinician of a possible occult disease. In patients already diagnosed with cancer, it often represents an ominous sign that indicates poor prognosis, due to the rapid progress of the disease. The case is presented of a 62-year-old man diagnosed with synchronous lung and bladder cancer, who suddenly complained of numbness in the chin. The bone scan confirmed the suspicion of metastastic bone disease, and the patient died two months after the appearance of this sign.",0,631

A previously healthy 11 year old girl was admitted with a chest mass of a month of evolution associated with fever, hyporexia and weight loss. Thoracic actinomycosis was diagnosed with the isolation of Actinomyces meyeri in the mass drainage. She received antibiotic treatment for a year with complete resolution. Although rare, it should be taken into account as a differential diagnosis in long evolution thoracic tumor affecting the general condition.

689,"Radioiodine uptake in the thyroid tissue, metastasis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), and in other tissues, depends on the expression of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Vascular permeability, effusions, inflammation, and other mechanisms may also play a role in the accumulation of radioactive iodine. A 63-year-old woman underwent radioiodine therapy, as well as a post-therapy whole-body scan, as she was suspected of having lung metastasis from thyroid carcinoma. The scan not only showed uptake at the lung metastasis but also a faint diffuse bilateral uptake in the posterior thorax. On SPECT/CT this uptake was located in a known Elastofibroma Dorsi (ED) previously diagnosed by contrast CT and viewed in a FDG PET/CT. The radioiodine uptake in ED, especially if typical, is not a diagnostic problem in SPECT/CT study, but can be misleading in a study limited to a few planar images, particularly if the uptake occurs asymmetrically, or ED is located in a unsuspected area.",0,985
690,"Objective:: To report our experience using scenario approximation in a phenomenological study of nursing in Mexico. Method:: Experience report on scenario approximation to coexist with elderly in order to select the participants of a phenomenological study. Results:: During a four-month period in 2016, visits were carried out two groups of elderly individuals where several activities were carried out. Coexistence with the elderly throughout accompaniment in the groups' activities together with joint dialogue allowed selection of those who corresponded to the characteristics of the study objective. Conclusion:: Scenario approximation is necessary in phenomenological studies, not only for creating empathy among the participants but also for the researchers to immerse themselves in the phenomenon under study, as shown by the first approaches of the researcher.

691,"Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria is an inborn error of metabolism of vitamin B12 or cobalamin. It's a rare autosomal recessive disease in which there are several variants depending on the pathogenesis of the metabolic disorder (cblC, cblD, cblF and cblJ). The more frequent and more severe is the cblC variant, which usually manifests in the first months of life, although some cases have been reported at the beginning of adulthood. A proper diagnosis and effective therapeutic approach is fundamental. We report the case of a patient of 18 years with a history of epilepsy who consults for acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy and diagnosed with combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria cblC variant.",0,749
692,"The 16p11.2 recurrent microdeletion phenotype is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or autism spectrum disorder. This microdeletion is associated with variable clinical outcome, the phenotypical spectrum ranges from intellectual disability and/or multiple congenital anomalies, autism, learning and speech problems, to a normal Microdelecion 16p11.2: primeros casos reportados en Argentina 16p11.2 Microdeletion: first report in Argentina phenotype. Genomic testing that determines copy number of sequences, such as chromosomal microarray, is used to identify this microdeletion. However, the prediction of the individual phenotype of a patient based only on the location of such deletion remains a challenge, regarding the existence of many genomic variants that might hinder the interpretation of possible functional effects between most of the contributing genes to that region. We describe the clinical findings in two subjects with heterozygous microdeletions at 16p11.2, highlighting the phenotypic and behavioural findings that conditioned the diagnostic strategy. We also discuss the implications of diagnosis, in practical counselling situations.",0,1187
693,"42-year-old man with pain in the posterolateral region of the right knee that began while he was running. Initially, it was diagnosed by magnetic resonance (MR) as a possible aggressive process (osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma) but with computed tomography it was noted a cortical hypodense linear longitudinal image with a continuous, homogeneous and solid periosteal reaction without clear soft tissue mass that in this patient suggest a longitudinal distal femoral fatigue stress fracture. This type of fracture at this location is very rare. Stress fractures are entities that can be confused with an agressive process. MR iscurrently the most sensitive and specific imaging method for its diagnosis.",0,704
694,"Coronary artery fistulae are abnormal connections between a coronary artery and any cardiac chamber or other vessels. Most of them have a congenital origin. We report a 60 years old woman referring a history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea during the last year. A continuous heart murmur was audible in the third and fourth intercostal spaces at the left sternal border. Electrocardiogram was normal and echocardiography showed mild dilation of right cavities and an image suggesting a dilated right coronary artery with flow to right atrium. Coronary angiography was performed, showing a normal left coronary artery and a very large, tortuous right coronary artery with an extensive communication to coronary venous sinus. Surgical treatment was decided and was performed without incidents. The patient is well after five years of follow up.",0,847
695,Gated-SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging is a widely used technique indicated for assessment of patients with no clear diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Early rest gated-SPECT myocardial perfusion study in patients with acute chest pain has high sensitivity and high negative predictive value for ruling out coronary disease. We report a case of a patient admitted for the study of her chest pain. She underwent a myocardial perfusion stress-rest whose interpretation could have been equivocal due to the clinical status of the patient during the injection of the radiotracer.,0,579

697,"Gorham-Stout syndrome is an extremely rare pathology, of unknown etiology. It is characterized by proliferation of vascular channels that causes destruction and reabsorption of the bone matrix. We present a nine year-old male patient with an acute episode characterized by fever, chest pain, respiratory distress and dyspnea. The patient was submitted to computed tomography scan and a biopsy. The findings in the biopsy were multiple lytic lesions, osteolysis, and a mediastinal lymphangioma (lymphangiomatosis). The diagnosis was Gorham-Stout syndrome with atypical presentation.",0,581
698,"We present two cases of lateral medullary stroke in subjects with extracranial trajectory of the postero-inferior cerebellar artery. Case 1: a 21-year-old male who presented ataxia and right dysmetria after cervical trauma in a rugby match. Case 2: 56-year-old woman, who started with vertigo and left hemiparesis after intense physical effort. In both cases, the angiographic studies showed an extracranial trajectory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This vessel rarely originates below the foramen magnum, in close relationship with the first three cervical vertebrae and the atlanto-axial joint. At this level, it is exposed to mechanical damage causing dissection, such as direct trauma, abrupt cervical manipulation or prolonged cephalic extension. Therefore, this association should be considered in patients with stroke of the lateral region of the bulb and extracranial trajectory of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery.",0,945

702,"Linezolid is an antibiotic of oxazolidinones family that inhibits proteical synthesis. It is used in several Gram-positive multirresistent infections. Its more frequent side effects are gastrointestinal, followed by peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy diagnosed with septic osteoarthritis of the hip and femoral osteomyelitis, following treatment with linezolid, who complained about digestive intolerance and weight loss. He showed severe normocytic anemia and mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia with data of hematopoiesis disorder in the blood smear that suggested drug toxicity. These findings reverted when the treatment was discontinued. Reversible myelosuppression associated with linezolid is related to long treatments (more than 28 days). So it is necessary to check the blood count during long treatments.",0,865
703,"INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is a rare immune disorder due to mutations in seven different genes that encode proteins called TREX1, ribonuclease H2 complex, SAMHD1, ADAR and IDIH1 (MDA5), which are involved in acid nucleic metabolism. Two cases are described in detail below caused by RNASEH2B gene mutation, one of which displays a mutation no described to date. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: male consulting because from 5-month-old shows loss of maturity items acquired until then, coming with several fever episodes. Case 2: a 4-month-old boy showing since 2-month-old great irritability and oral-feeding trouble with severe psychomotor impairment. In both cases it was found an increase of pterines in the cerebrospinal fluid, mainly neopterine, with calcifications in the basal ganglia. The diagnosis was proved by sequencing RNASEH2B gene, founding in case 2 a new mutation not described previously. CONCLUSIONS: The reported cases belong to the description already done by Aicardi-Goutieres, it should be noticed this syndrome in a patient with a subacute encephalopathy of debut in the first year of life, dystonia/spasticity in variable degree and important affectation/regression of psychomotor development, particularly in those with increase of pterines (neopterine) in the cerebrospinal fluid and calcifications in the basal ganglia.",0,1351
704,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 48,960 people in the USA will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 and 40,560 will die for this reason; in Mexico, the new cases of pancreatic cancer in 2012 were 4,274, with 4,133 deaths; survival rate at 5 years goes from 1% to15%. Less than 20% of cases were considered resectable at the time of diagnosis. The Whipple procedure is currently the only curative treatment option for periampullary cancers since the first communication by Whipple in 1935, and up until now is a common procedure in several reference centres around the world. In 1994, Gagner reported the first totally laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. Some groups have currently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this technique. OBJECTIVE: To report our initial experience with totally laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Hospital General de Mexico. CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns a 58 year-old women with jaundice and loss of weight of 3 months onset. Her biopsy reported adenocarcinoma of Vater's ampulla, and as it was considered resectable, she underwent a laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This procedure must be performed in centres with experience in open pancreatic surgery and training in advanced laparoscopic surgery. The main advantages are lower blood loss and shorter hospital stay.",0,1333

709,"BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is the third most common muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 20.000 and a normal life expectancy in the majority of patients. However, approximately 15% of patients become wheelchair bound in the course of their life. It is a hereditary autosomal dominant disease with high (95%) penetrance by the age of 20, but with variable degree of phenotypic expression even in the same family group. Symptoms frequently start in the second decade of life, with facial and scapular weakness. AIM: To report the clinical features of seven patients with the disease, seen at a public hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of seven patients with genetic study seen in a public Hospital in Santiago. RESULTS: The age of patients fluctuated from 18 to 61 years and four were females. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 29 years and four had a family history of the disease. The usual presenting complaint was arm or shoulder asymmetric weakness. Four patients had bone pain. Facial involvement was present in four. A genetic study was done in five patients, the other two patients were relatives, confirming the contraction or lower number of repetitions in D4Z4 region. After 12 years of follow up only 2 patients older than 60 years cannot work and one female patients is in a semi dependent state at the age of 30. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical workup in the diagnosis and the timely indication of genetic studies are highlighted, to avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures. The variability in the phenotypic expression in a similar genetic defect is discussed and the genetic or epigenetic mechanisms of this muscular dystrophy are described.",0,1706
710,Intracranial sinus venous thrombosis (ICSVT) is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis that affects from 1.7 to 7.5% of patients. We report a 22 year-old male with ulcerative colitis in treatment with mesalazine and prednisone presenting with headache and speech disturbances. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left temporal hemorrhagic infarct with thrombosis of the ispilateral superficial vein and sigmoid venous sinus. No cause of thrombophilia was detected. Anticoagulation with heparin was started which was changed to oral anticoagulation with warfarin. The patient was discharged ten days after admission.,0,633
711,"INTRODUCTION: Lipoblastoma is a benign neoplasia of the adipose tissue. It is a rare conditionand almost exclusively presents in children under 3 years old. It usually occurs in extremities as a painless volume increase of progressive growth, with the definitive diagnosis being established by pathological and cytogenetic analysis. The treatment of choice is complete resection, and follow-up period of up to five years is recommended due to a recurrence of up to 25%. OBJECTIVE: To present an unusual location of this uncommon condition in an infant, and review the related literature. CASE REPORT: A sixteen-month child with an increase in abdominal growth of six-months progression, associated with a decreased food intake, and with no other symptoms. The imaging study revealed a lipoid-like image compromising almost the entire abdominal cavity, very suggestive of lipoblastoma. A resection was performed on an 18cm diameter retroperitoneal tumour that rejected the adjacent organs. Histological analysis was enough to confirm diagnosis without the need for cytogenetic analysis. The follow-up showed no recurrence of the disease. CONCLUSION: Given the rarity of this disease and its unusual presentation, we communicate this clinical case, in order to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal mass in chilhood.",0,1333
712,"Mucormycosis is usually an acute angioinvasive infections, which leads to non-suppurative necrosis and significant tissue damage. It represents 1.6% of all the invasive fungal infections and predominates in immunosuppressed patients with risk factors. Incidence has been significantly increased even in immunocompetent patients. Due to finding a case of disseminated mucormycosis caused by Rhizomucor pusillus in a young immunocompetent patient, a systematic review was carried out of reported cases in PubMed of mucormycosis in immunocompetent adults according to the main anatomic locations, and especially in disseminated cases. A review of the main risk factors and pathogenicity, clinical manifestations, techniques of early diagnosis, current treatment options, and prognosis is presented.

713,"Distant soft-tissue metastases (subcutaneous tissues and skeletal muscle) are extremely rare, particularly in oesophageal carcinoma. The case is described of a patient who was treated for oesophageal adenocarcinoma 2.5 years previously. A PET/CT was performed showing metastatic spread due to a solitary focus of increased tracer uptake corresponding to one subcutaneous node in the upper abdomen. An excisional biopsy showed a metastasis from the carcinoma. Restaging PET/CT (18)F-FDG study was performed 2 year later, demonstrating foci of increased uptake within several muscles as isolated distant haematogenous spread of metastases, histopathologically confirmed. As most of soft-tissue metastases are asymptomatic, the physicians should recommend a histopathological study of focal FDG uptake at subcutaneous tissues and/or skeletal muscles, because they may be the first sign of disease spread, so therapeutic management of these patients could be changed.",0,963
714,"Goldbloom syndrome is a rare clinical entity, of unknown etiology that happens almost exclusively in pediatric population. It is a prolonged febrile syndrome with periosteal hyperostosis and dysproteinemia, and often simulates an hematooncology or lymphoproliferative disease. The diagnosis is to rule out the different causes of bone pain associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and periostitis at the radiographies. Symptomatology, radiology and laboratory parameters refer in a variable time, usually from 3 to 12 months. We report the case of a six-year-old boy with diffuse bone pain, prolonged febrile syndrome (of 8 months of evolution), weight loss and elevated acute phase reactants with dysproteinemia (hypergammaglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia). Goldbloom syndrome should be considered in patients with prolonged febrile syndrome and cortical hyperostosis after the exclusion of infectious, lymphoproliferative or inflammatory disease.",0,1000
715,"INTRODUCTION: 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome is a caused by a recurrent deletion of the 1q21.1 copy-number variant, which spans 800 kb and includes at least seven genes. It is associated with a variable phenotype. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities have been previously described in many of the previously reported cases, but its true prevalence is unknown. AIM: To illustrate the phenotypic variability in 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome. CASE REPORTS: Four individuals of the same kindred harboring a 1.74-Mb deletion within 1q21.1 are included. In our patients a heterogeneous phenotype is recognized. Neuropsychiatric disorders or more specifically impulse control disorders were common to all the four cases that we present. CONCLUSIONS: 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome is phenotypically heterogeneous even among members of the same family. Behavioral or neuropsychiatric abnormalities are frequent. Paucisymptomatic forms with individuals presenting exclusively psychiatric disorders have been identified.",0,1002
716,"Influenza vaccine is rarely associated with neurological adverse effects such as Guillain Barre syndrome, encephalitis or aseptic meningitis. We report the case of a male patient that presented two episodes of acute encephalitis in consecutive years, 16 and 20 days after his annual influenza vaccine shot, respectively. In both instances, patient required ICU admission and evolved with fast recovery and no sequels. The first episode was managed empirically as herpetic encephalitis but an extensive study was performed in the second episode without identifying any microorganism. Neuroimaging studies also discarded acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Mild pleocytosis of mononuclear predominance was detected in both cases in CSF. Naranjo score punctuated 8 points indicating a probable causal relationship. Acute encephalitis is a rare adverse effect of influenza vaccine and occurs several days after immunization. It has a broad differential diagnosis, and appears to be of self-limited duration and associated with good prognosis.",0,1040
717,"CASE REPORT: A 4 year-old girl was referred to our hospital after have suffered a severe accident. The patient was diagnosed with complete third nerve palsy in her right eye and Purtscher retinopathy in her left eye. DISCUSSION: Purtscher retinopathy is a rare condition. The diagnosis is made on clinical ground and its treatment is not well defined although it is believed that systemic steroids could improve the visual outcome. Traumatic third nerve palsy has a poor spontaneous recovery. The use of botulinum toxin might be useful in children to improve the recovery rate, maintaining binocularity, and avoiding amblyopia in other cases.",0,642
718,"We report a male infant with midline defects, congenital heart disease and polydactyly, features suggestive of trisomy 13. However, the report of the karyotype was normal. By clinical findings the final diagnosis was likely to be Pseudotrisomy 13. Although the prognosis is poor in both conditions, the genetic study is always necessary to establish an adequate genetic counseling. Although there are syndromes with similar presentation as Meckel syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome and hydrolethalus, it is possible to make a diagnostic approach based on the perinatal history, birth weight, survival time, and some characteristics of each syndrome. However, limitations may exist to perform genetic studies in some countries, therefore the clinical criteria may be relevant.",0,802
719,"Neurohistoplasmosis is a rare disease, most prevalent in immunosuppressed patients, secondary to disseminated disease with a high mortality rate when diagnosis and treatment are delayed. We report a previously healthy 12 year old girl, from a bat infested region of Tucuman Province, Argentine Republic, who developed meningoencephalitis due to Histoplasma capsulatum. Eighteen months prior to admission the patient started with headaches and intermittent fever. The images of the central nervous system showed meningoencephalitis suggestive of tuberculosis. She received antibiotics and tuberculostatic medications without improvement. Liposomal amphotericin B was administered for six weeks. The patient's clinical status improved remarkably. Finally the culture of cerebral spinal fluid was positive for micelial form of Histoplasma capsulatum. The difficulties surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of neurohistoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients are discussed in this manuscript, as it also intends to alert to the presence of a strain of Histoplasma capsulatum with affinity for the central nervous system.",0,1117
720,"Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) is widely used in neonatal intensive care units. Pericardial effusion is an uncommon but life-threatening complication; and tamponade have been reported in 3% of neonates having such catheters. We present a case of cardiac tamponade as a complication of venous catheter in a neonate. The patient was diagnosed at the appropriate time by echocardiography and the pericardiocentesis was performed, and after removal of the complete pericardial effusion,an improvement of the critical condition was achieved. It is important to document the optimal positioning of UVC before the start of infusions.",0,627
721,"Liver impairment is commonly reported in up to 60% of patients who suffer from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Here we report the clinical course and liver pathology in three SARS patients with liver impairment. Three patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS and developed marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase were included. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed. Liver specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using enhanced real-time PCR was applied to look for evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus infection. Marked accumulation of cells in mitosis was observed in two patients and apoptosis was observed in all three patients. Other common pathologic features included ballooning of hepatocytes and mild to moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. No eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma, cholestasis, fibrosis, or fibrin deposition was noted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed 0.5% to 11.4% of nuclei were positive for proliferative antigen Ki-67. RT-PCR showed evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus in the liver tissues, but not in the sera of all 3 patients. However, electron microscopy could not identify viral particles. No giant mitochondria, micro- or macro-vesicular steatosis was observed. In conclusion, hepatic impairment in patients with SARS is due to SARS-associated coronavirus infection of the liver. The prominence of mitotic activity of hepatocytes is unique and may be due to a hyperproliferative state with or without disruption of cell cycle by the coronavirus. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, specific therapy may be targeted to reduce viral replication and modify the disease course.",1,1796
722,EN: We report the use of mechanical venous thrombectomy in 2 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in which the usual first-choice treatment with systemic anticoagulants was contraindicated. Our aim is to present this treatment as an alternative to consider when anticoagulants therapy is too risky or is contraindicated in critically ill patients.,0,352
723,"In Chile, loxoscelism is caused by the bite of the Loxosceles laeta spider. The clinical presentation has two different forms: cutaneous loxoscelism (CL) and vicero-cutaneous loxoscelism, which is less frequent. Cutaneous loxoscelism includes an uncommon clinical variation (4%), called CL with edematous predominance (CLEP). We present a 5-year-old patient with sudden pain and edema on his right eyelid associated with fever, which progressed rapidly involving the right hemifacial area, frontal region, and left eyelid. Angioedema and pre-orbital cellulitis were discarded and CLEP was suspect. Cutaneous loxoscelism with an edematous predominance is self-limited, benign and with little or no necrotic injury due to the edema, which dilutes the toxin-induced enzymatic process causing necrosis. As in the reported cases it usually responds well to medical treatment and does not cause visceral involvement.",0,910
724,"BACKGROUND: Choledochal cysts are rare. They usually present during childhood in women, but it can also be seen during pregnancy. Clinical signs and symptoms are obscured during this time, thus it can complicate the diagnosis and represent a life threatening complication for both the mother and the child. OBJECTIVE: To communicate the case of 3 pregnant patients with choledochal cyst. CLINICAL CASES: Three pregnant women in which choledochal cyst were diagnosed. Two developed signs of cholangitis. The first one underwent a hepatic-jejunostomy, but had an abortion and died on postoperative day 10. The second one had a preterm caesarean operation due to foetal distress and underwent a hepatic-jejunostomy 4 weeks later; during her recovery she had a gastric perforation and died of septic complications. The third one did not develop cholangitis or jaundice. She had an uneventful pregnancy and had a hepatic-jejunostomy 4 weeks later with good results. CONCLUSIONS: Management of choledochal cysts during pregnancy is related to the presence of cholangitis. When they do not respond to medical treatment, decompression of the biliary tree is indicated. Definitive treatment should be performed after resolution of the pregnancy.",0,1236
725,"Tigecycline is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent, structurally similar to minocycline and that shares some tetracycline-related side effects. A case report is presented on a 68-year-old female who received tigecycline for a sepsis of unknown origin and who, in the following 5days, developed abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes, which suggested acute pancreatitis. After ruling out other origins, and according to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, tigecycline was the probable cause of the acute pancreatitis, a complication that has been reported 5 times in the database of the Spanish pharmacosurveillance system since 2009. Close monitoring of abdominal signs and symptoms is recommended during treatment with tigecycline, since adverse effects affecting the digestive system are the most prevalent ones when using this drug.",0,861
726,"Giant nonparasitic splenic epidermoid cysts are relatively uncommon. These lesions can lead abdominal pain, but most of then are asymptomatic, and they are discovered incidentally. We report a 13-y old female with a giant splenic epidermoid cystic, given the special interest of diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making of this rare entity. CASE REPORT: A 13-y old female with clinical history of abdominal pain since the last two months. On physical examination a firm, tender mass was palpable in left hypochondrium. Diagnosis of a large cystic splenic mass was made based on ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan. Splenectomy was performed, and histopathological-immunohistochemistry studies revealed findings suggestive of primary epithelial cyst. The post-operative clinical course was satisfactory and uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of giant nonparasitic splenic cysts is surgical. Preserve splenic parenchyma must be the aim in an individualized decision-making. The different types of surgical modalities will be according to the diagnosis and clinical situation (cyst size, age, comorbidities).",0,1121
727,"Cushing's syndrome is a rare condition during pregnancy, but it is associated with serious maternal and fetal complications. The most common etiology during pregnancy is the presence of an adrenocortical adenoma. Urinary free cortisol over 3 times the upper limit of normal usually indicates Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy. The treatment of choice is surgical, and the ideal time for surgery is before the third trimester.",0,427
728,"INTRODUCTION: Intracranial angioleiomyomas are extremely rare lesions. Only 22 intracranial angioleiomyomas have been described in the literature and only three were infratentorial. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an infratentorial angioleiomyoma in a 43 year-old-man, who underwent a brain computer tomography because of hearing loss. The MRI showed a 1.4 cm tumor, initially described as a meningioma, with progressive enhancement after gadolinium injection, an augmented apparent diffusion coefficient and a generalized metabolite decreased in the spectroscopy. The lesion was surgically removed through a suboccipital approach with a good evolution and without postoperative complications. In the immunohistological study, the lesion was mainly composed of multiple vessels and the immunohistochemistry was positive for actin and caldesmon. Two years after surgery, no recurrence has been found in the MRI. CONCLUSION: Angioleiomyomas diagnostic may be complex, but some radiological features could help in the differential diagnostic. Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors associated with favorable outcomes after total resection, that in our case, did not show a significant bleeding risk.",0,1192
729,"Ischemic hepatitis (IH) is a rare entity, usually associated with hypoperfusion secondary to low cardiac output (congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy), followed in frequency by respiratory insufficiency and sepsis. A 49-year-old man presented at the emergency room with progressive dyspnea and hypotension, objectifying a significant increase in transaminases (aspartate transferase 5.550 U / L, alanine transferase 3.826 U / L) and LDH (10.375 U / L). Liver Doppler ultrasound was normal. The echocardiogram confirmed the suspected diagnosis of massive pericardial effusion. Cardiac tamponade is a rare cause for this clinical picture.

It is a fibroblastic tumor with a deceptively benign appearance, which may produce local recurrences and late distant metastases. We present a case of an 11-year-old girl with a lesion on her thigh that was completely excised. Histopathology revealed a well-delimited neoplasm with myxoid stroma and fusiform cellularity without atypia or mitosis. Immunohistochemical expression of MUC4, together with molecular biology, which detected FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene expression, confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. We review the differential diagnosis of soft-tissue myxoid tumors, especially those with a benign appearance, highlighting the importance of immunohistochemical and molecular studies to rule out low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.",0,839
732,"UNLABELLED: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory follicular skin disease. It usually presents as recurrent, deep nodules in flexural apocrine gland bearing areas. It appears mainly in women, in the second and third decade of life. OBJECTIVE: To present 2 cases of patients with prepuberal HS. CASE 1: A 10-year old female, Tanner stage I-II and obesity. History of 4 months of evolution with bilateral recurrent groin lesions that occasionally drain pus; HS Hurley stage i was diagnosed, and topical antibiotics and nutritional management were prescribed, with a good response. CASE 2: A 10 years old female, Tanner stage I-II and obesity. Since the age of 6 years, recurrent episodes of lesions in the inner side of the left thigh were observed, and multiple antibiotics with poor response were prescribed. HS Hurley stage i was diagnosed, and photodynamic therapy and nutritional management were used, with good response. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of HS is unclear. Usually the presentation at early age is associated with a family history and more extensive compromise in the future. Treatment is difficult and depends on each case and severity.",0,1160
733,"Thoracoscopic micro-discectomy is a treatment option for thoracic disc disease that combines the advantages of the anterior approach and the benefits of a minimally invasive technique. Adding a navigation system provides many advantages to the usual technique, as it allows accurate marking of the lesion level, improvement in the surgical approach, and precise control of herniated disc resection and vertebral osteotomy. The navigation system also reduces the learning curve for thoracoscopic technique. We report our experience in the treatment of thoracic disc herniation with image-guided thoracoscopy.",0,607
734,"We present the case of a 62-year-old woman who consulted for fever (38 degrees ), stabbing thoracic pain (on one side), and pruritic skin lesions. She underwent peripheral blood tests, chest X-rays and CT. Her symptoms were interpreted as severe communityacquired pneumonia. After a treatment with antibiotics, her skin lesions persisted, and other symptoms were only partially relieved. A skin biopsy was performed, which revealed Treponema pallidum. Such finding was confirmed through positive serum VDRL and FTA-ABS tests. The patient received 4 doses of benzathine penicillin G with favorable evolution of skin lesions and improvement of radiological images.",0,662
735,"INTRODUCTION: A deficiency of the enzyme guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH 1) causes a reduction in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor that is essential in the synthesis of tyrosine, dopamine and serotonin. It is an infrequent disease that produces psychomotor delay or regression and movement disorders, although treatment can improve or even correct the clinical signs and symptoms. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a girl with autosomal recessive GTPCH deficiency, who was diagnosed at 14 months by means of an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid with pterin, HVA and 5-HIAA deficiency, and positive phenylalanine overload test and genetic study. The clinical features began at the age of 5 months with intermittent upper limb and brain tremors, both at rest and intentional, that disappeared after a month. Psychomotor development was normal, mild axial hypotonia being found in the examination while the complementary tests that were performed were normal. The patient later presented psychomotor regression with loss of head control, diminished active movements, difficulty in bimanual manipulation, hypomimia and severe global hypotonia, which was the reason for the study of a progressive encephalopathy. Following the diagnosis of GTPCH deficiency, replacement therapy was established with levodopa/carbidopa, OH tryptophan and BH4, with excellent progress made in motor and cognitive functioning. Today, the patient is 5 years old, has an adequate psychomotor development for her age, is in the third year of preschool education and has caught up with the level of the rest of her classmates. CONCLUSION: In this case attention must be drawn to the extremely satisfactory motor and cognitive improvement of the patient after starting replacement therapy, as in many cases the cognitive level is usually affected on a permanent basis.",0,1878
736,"Multiple cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are thought to be exceedingly rare lesions and have usually been reported as single cases. The incidence of multiple cerebral AVMs in major series ranges from 0.3% to 9% and, in the majority of cases, these malformations are associated with other vascular anomalies of the brain or soft tissues. We report a 62-year-old woman that presented with a left temporal haemorrhage. Angiography showed 3 AVMs located in the left temporal lobe, left cerebellar hemisphere and right temporal lobe. The lesions were treated with radiosurgery.",0,584
737,"BACKGROUND: Carcinoid of the small intestine, is a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor that rarely presents with clinical signs. This tumour can be associated with other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, presenting a wide range of symptoms. In some cases they have an aggressive and highly symptomatic behaviour; thus, clinical suspicion must be high to make an early diagnosis. CLINICAL CASE: A 60 year-old male patient with Crohn's disease and gastrointestinal symptoms attributed to this disease within the last year. He presented with intestinal obstruction initially treated with conservative management with no improvement. Exploratory laparotomy was performed finding a mesenteric tumour that caused the bowel obstruction. Bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. The pathology report showed an intestinal carcinoid tumour with lymph node metastases. The patient recovered well, and was discharged without complications to continue medical treatment and follow-up by the Oncology department. CONCLUSION: In almost 42% of the cases, the most common site of carcinoid tumours is the small intestine, and of these, 41% are presented as locoregional disease. Patients with Crohn's disease present a higher incidence. In these cases, the most common presentation is an acute intestinal obstruction (90%). Surgery is usually curative, and follow up is important as the symptoms of Crohn's disease can hide any recurrence.",0,1456
738,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which preferentially attacks the optic nerve and spinal cord. It is associated with antibodies against aquaporin 4. Morbidity and mortality are higher than in multiple sclerosis and its treatment focuses on immunosuppressive drugs. Immunomodulators are contraindicated. We report a previously healthy 35-year-old man, presenting with NMO concomitantly with systemic lupus erythematosus. His evolution was torpid with three outbreaks in the 10 months after the diagnosis, requiring a first-line therapy with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide and then a second-line therapy with rituximab.",0,685
739,"Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle is a primary central nervous system tumor introduced in the group of glioneuronal tumors in the WHO classification of 2007. Initially it was described around the fourth ventricle, but recently have been published cases in different locations. We present 2cases of this rare tumor, both surgically treated. The first in a 41 year old man with typical symptoms of posterior fossa injury. The second in an 18 year old woman, with incidental finding of posterior fossa injury that was also surgically treated. We present pre- and post-surgical magnetic resonance images, histological pictures of this tumor and we make a review of the literature.",0,701
740,"Pharmacologic hypersensitivities commonly express cutaneous manifestations, and the highest mortality is found in Stevens Johnson's syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, mostly associated with antibiotics and anticonvulsive drugs. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is related in 80% of cases to pharmacologic hypersensitivity and systemic consequences may be found; hepatic injury has been described, but the finding of liver abscesses has not been reported among common injuries.

742,"The case involves a 34-year-old woman who underwent surgical removal of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma adjacent to the left kidney's lower pole, previously visualized by CT and MRI. The (123)I-MIBG scan was positive for this lesion and, in addition, another uptake was observed located caudally at the level of L5 and of smaller size and less intensity. The second lesion was not considered for surgical removal, due to its lack of morphological definition. One week after surgical intervention, the patient presented difficult-to-control high blood pressure. A second (123)I-MIBG scan was performed. The previously described second image was more intense in this study, and surgery was planned to remove it. A combination of techniques including freehand-SPECT and a portable hybrid gamma camera (with optical camera) were used pre-operatively to identify the location of the lesion. The combination of intra-operative laparoscopic gamma probe and portable hybrid gamma camera enabled the tumor to be located, excised, and its complete removal to be monitored. The histopathology analysis confirmed a second paraganglioma.",0,1124
743,"Amyloidosis is a term that involves a group of diseases characterised by deposition of extracellular monoclonal light-chain fibrillar immunoglobulin aggregates in the body, including many organs, with the larynx among them. A case is presented of a 78 year-old man who was referred to our institution for strangulated umbilical hernia treatment. He suffered from progressive hoarseness and dysphagia for 5months. He had a history of primary laryngeal amyloidosis. Awake intubation was performed successful with the King Vision((R)) video-laryngoscopy. Sedation was achieved using a remifentanil infusion and midazolam. Haemorrhagic lesions are caused by deposition of amyloid in and around vessels, resulting in increased vascular fragility. Therefore, anaesthetists should take care in intubating the tracheas of these patients.",0,829
744,"A case is presented of a 61 year-old man with a personal history of serpiginous choroiditis (SC), who presented with metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity (VA) in his right eye (RE). In the examination, using Swept Source OCT-angiography (SS OCT-A), peripapillary haemorrhage secondary to a choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) was observed. The patient was treated with intravitreal aflibercept, having a favourable outcome on his symptomatology and in the SS OCT-A findings. CNV is a complication that can appear in up to 25% of cases after SC. An accurate diagnosis using SS OCT-A, with early treatment with aflibercept, led us to obtain optimal clinical and anatomical results.",0,684

746,"Rituximab is a plausible alternative first-line treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Adverse effects related to its infusion are common and usually have a benign course. However, there have been reports of refractory cardiogenic shock simulating septic shock. We report an 81-year-old male with the diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis. Rituximab 500 mg was administered intravenously for a relapse. The infusion proceeded without incident. However, 24 hours after its administration the patient began with fever, chills, coughing and strong malaise. The patient was transferred to the critical patient unit where a septic shock was suspected and resuscitative measures were started. However, the fast response to moderate doses of vasoactive drugs and complementary tests did not support an infectious etiology for the shock. Antimicrobials were discontinued and systemic corticosteroids were maintained, achieving remission of the symptoms. Shock as an unusual adverse reaction to Rituximab was suspected.",0,1014
747,"The case is presented of a 32 year-old male who arrived with acute bilateral symptoms with blurred vision, red eye, severe photophobia and severe ocular pain after suffering from a flu-like syndrome. The patient presented with a clinical picture of bilateral involvement characterised by pupils in mid-mydriasis, scarcely reactive to light, iris transillumination, diffuse depigmentation of the iridian stroma, pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, and ocular hypertension. After the eye examination an inflammatory syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma were ruled out. The patient showed depigmentation characteristics as well as bilateral iris transillumination. Both conditions could form part of the spectrum of the same disease.",0,734
748,"A 30 year old male presented with a cutaneous lesion on the distal area of the 5th toe with involvement of the outer edges. Macroscopically, it was a 1cm violaceous and keratotic lesion. Radiography showed an increase in soft tissue, possibly due to a vascular lesion. MRI showed a hyper-intense signal with erosion of the distal phalanx compatible with a low-flow vascular malformation. The distal phalanx was amputated. Histopathology revealed a lesion formed by venous and D2-40 positive lymphatic vessels. This case highlights the fact that even minimal skin involvement in vascular malformations may conceal an important deeper lesion, such as erosion of the cortical bone.",0,678

750,"Hyperthyroidism is a relatively frequent condition with multiple causes. The most common cause is Graves' disease; followed by hyperthyroid multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma. Association between hyperthyroidism and cancer is infrequent in daily practice. We present the case of a 42-year-old man who developed severe symptoms of hyperthyroidism within a period of two months. Physical examination revealed significant hepatomegaly. Testicular examination proved normal. Imaging studies showed the presence of multiple hepatic solid lesions consistent with metastases. After discarding the most common causes of hyperthyroidism and primary thyroid gland neoplasm, the possibility of molecular mimicry was considered through human chorionic gonadotrophin production. Critical high values of this hormone were found and choriocarcinoma histological diagnosis was confirmed through a liver biopsy. We consider that the recognition of this rare mechanism of hyperthyroidism may be a clue permitting a faster diagnosis, particularly when extragonadal tumors are present.",0,1068
751,"INTRODUCTION: Ohtahara syndrome (OS, OMIM#308350, ORPHA1934) is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) characterised by spasms, intractable seizures, suppression-burst pattern on the electroencephalogram, and severe psychomotor retardation. Mutations in STXBP1 -a gene that codes for syntaxin binding protein 1 and is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis- has been identified in most patients with OS. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We report the case of a 19-month-old child with OS who displays a previously unreported mutation in STXBP1 (c.1249+2T>C, G417AfsX7). This mutation is located in a donor splice site and eliminates exon 14, resulting in a truncated protein. CONCLUSION: This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with Ohtahara syndrome and non-lesional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) broadens the mutational spectrum associated with this devastating epileptic syndrome.",0,899

Therefore, it seems necessary to perform routine eye examinations, from an early age, to prevent serious complications associated with corneal anaesthesia.",0,483
753,"OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of urachal adenocarcinoma and to review the published literature. METHODS / RESULTS: We present a review of our urachal carcinoma cases from a third level hospital between 1990-2011 in an area of 520.000 inhabitants. Both cases were middle aged men, consulting for repeated urine infections, and abdominal mass with hematuria and mucous discharge through the urethra. They were treated initially with partial cystectomy and adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy in one case, and chemo and radiotherapy in the other. The first case died in 3 years and the other is still alive after 4 years of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Urachal adenocarcinomas of the bladder are rare tumors the natural history of which has not changed during the last years. Open partial cystectomy with en bloc resection of the bladder dome, urachus and the umbilicus is the standard treatment in localized stages, although minimal invasive techniques appear to have the same oncological outcomes. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is advised. Most of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced local or metastatic stage. There is a need to improve diagnostic techniques for early treatment and to find new chemotherapy protocols that can help to improve these patients' survival.",0,1264
754,"BACKGROUND: Fractures of the chest wall include sternum and rib fractures. Traditionally they are managed conservatively due to the anatomy of the rib cage that allows most of them to remain stable and to form a callus that unites the fractured segments. In spite of this management, some patients present with chronic pain or instability of the wall which makes them require some type of fixation. The present article performs a literature review based on 4 cases. CLINICAL CASES: The first case was a 61 year-old man with blunt chest trauma, with a great deformity of the chest wall associated with subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax. The second case was a 51 year-old man with blunt chest trauma, initially managed at another institution, who despite treatment, had persistent pain and dyspnoea. The third case was a 30 year-old man that suffered a motor vehicle accident, with resulting pain and crepitation of the rib cage and with diagnostic images showing multiple rib fractures. The last case is a 62 year-old man that fell down the stairs, with blunt chest trauma with high intensity pain, dyspnoea and basal ipsilateral hypoventilation. CONCLUSION: Rib fracture fixation offers a good alternative in selected patients to decrease associated morbidity, leading to a patient's fast return to his or her working life.",0,1330
755,"BACKGROUND: Large vessel sarcomas are rare tumours. Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is the most common. About 300 cases have been reported in the literature. They tend to be large, and not develop metastasis. The prognosis of these tumours is poor. CLINICAL CASE: An 81 year-old woman who complained of pain in the right flank, with no other symptoms. Abdominal computed tomography showed a large retroperitoneal mass, which affected the inferior vena cava, with signs of thrombosis inside. It also encompassed the right renal vein and the right kidney. Excision of the tumour was performed in block, performing an autologous saphenous vein bypass between left the renal vein and proximal segment of inferior vena cava. DISCUSSION: Leiomyosarcomas of the inferior vena cava are classified according to their relationship with adjacent structures. The clinical signs and symptoms are generally non-specific. Diagnosis is made using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass. Surgery is the only treatment capable of providing prolonged survival. The surgical management is determined by: the level of involvement, the extension, and the presence or absence of collateral veins. The role of adjuvant therapy is controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior vena cava leiomyosarcomas remain a challenge for surgeons. At present, radical resection with negative margins, offers the highest survival rate. The best results are obtained with a multidisciplinary approach by experienced teams in the management of these tumours.",0,1569
756,"Chagas disease (ChD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an endemic anthropozoonosis in Latin America, linked to deficients socio-economic and cultural aspects and is considered one of the neglected tropical diseases.

757,"Echinococcosis is a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus granulosus, which, in its cystic state, forms the socalled hydatid cyst. It presents important morbidity, with possible sequelae related to the location, and high costs due to surgical and prolonged pharmacological treatment. The liver and the lung are the most common anatomical locations, and much rarer are the kidney, spleen, brain, and heart, where the latter represents 0.5 to 2% of total cases. Peru is an endemic country of this anthropozoonosis and mainly records cases in the central highlands (95%). This paper presents the case of a 10-year-old girl, diagnosed with this disease, CE1 ultrasound classification, clinical group 1 (confirmed by pathological anatomy) with specific surgical and pharmacological treatment (albendazole) afterward.

758,"BACKGROUND: Herniated thoracic intervertebral disc is a rare cause of spinal cord compression. Its frequency varies from 0.15% to 1.7% of all disc herniations, and produces symptoms in 0.5% to 0.8%. CLINICAL CASES: Case 1. A 50-year-old woman, with pain and burning sensation in left hemithorax of four months of onset. It was treated as a herpetic syndrome, with no improvement. She was seen after thirteen days of exacerbation of clinical symptoms. The physical examination showed asymmetric paraparesis, lower left pelvic limb 1/5, and right pelvic limb 3/5 sensory level T8, with left Babinski positive. A thoracic disc herniation in space T8-T9 was diagnosed. CASE 2: A 55-year-old patient with a history of presenting pain in lumbar area of 5 years onset. She also had radicular pain that radiated to the right pelvic limb, with intensity 10/10 on a Visual Analogue Scale. Her physical examination showed muscle strength 5/5, with normal sensitivity in all dermatomes and tendon reflexes, and a positive right Babinski. Thoracic disc herniation T7-T8 level was diagnosed. DISCUSSION: Due to anatomical conditions that define this type of hernia, the extracavitary posterolateral approach should be the recommended surgical procedure when the simultaneously performed anterior decompression and fixation with posterior instrumentation are the treatments proposed. CONCLUSION: Despite the different anatomical structures of this special area, it was possible to obtain satisfactory results for both clinical cases.",0,1518

761,"INTRODUCTION: The failure rate for anti-incontinence surgery ranges from 5% to 80%. There is not actual consensus on the use of artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) as treatment for recurrent urinary incontinence in women. Several authors have shown that AUS can be useful, if the intrinsic sphincteric deficiency is checked. We present the first case in Spain, to our knowledge, of laparoscopic implantation of AUS as treatment for female recurrent urinary incontinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Under general anaesthesia, patient was placed in supine decubitus with slight Trendelenburg, access to the vagina was verified. Through a transperitoneal pelvic laparoscopic approach, Retzius space was opened and then the laterovaginal spaces up to the endopelvic fascia. To facilitate the dissection of the bladder neck, we inserted a swab into the vagina, performing simultaneous traction and countertraction manoeuvres. As an access port for the AUS, we widened the incision of the lower trocar. We adjusted the periurethral cuff and then placed the reservoir and the pump in the laterovesical space and the labia majora of the vulva, respectively. Lastly, we connected the 3 AUS elements and peritoneum was closed to isolate AUS from the intestine. RESULTS: The surgical time was 92min, the estimated blood loss was <100cc(3) and the hospital stay was 48h. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The AUS was activated at 6 weeks. At 24 months, patient managed the AUS adequately and total continence was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic implantation of AUS is a feasible technique. Transvaginal traction and countertraction manoeuvres can prevent intraoperative lesions.",0,1691

763,"PURPOSE: To present the successful results of the single-bone reconstruction technique in the forearm in a patient who sustained an ulnar fracture and underwent multiple osteosyntheses and failed grafts. CASE: Male patient, agricultural worker, who at age 39 sustained a left ulnar fracture. After 13 years and 5 surgeries involving different types of osteosyntheses and failed grafts, which resulted in infection of the left ulnar pseudoarthrosis, we decided to do a single-bone reconstruction of the forearm. He did well and achieved good function. His current status is: 20 degrees of forearm supination, full elbow and wrist flexion and extension, appropriate muscle strength, and he returned to his job without functional limitations. CONCLUSION: The single-bone forearm reconstruction technique is, in properly selected cases, an excellent surgical alternative when reconstruction or salvage of the thoracic limb is required.",0,931
764,"UNLABELLED: Aortic aneurysms (AA) in the paediatric population are uncommon. The use of umbilical catheters in neonates has been associated with infections and, on some occasions, the formation of aortic aneurysms. The surgical repair of these aneurysms is one type of treatment; however, percutaneous intervention with stents could provide an alternative treatment route, with fewer complications. The aim of this report is to present the therapeutic scope of a hybrid procedure, in which the combined surgical and percutaneous technique offers a less invasive alternative to open surgery for the repair of aortic aneurysms or their main branches. CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns a pre-term newborn of 30 weeks weighing 1,335 g. An umbilical catheter was introduced, which was withdrawn at 14 days due to an infection. It developed as Staphylococcus aureus with sepsis. The echocardiogram and Angio-CT confirmed AA, which were managed using a hybrid procedure of surgery and the endovascular implantation of 2 coated stents (Atrium V12 XR Medical Corp, Hudson, NH). The post-procedure clinical follow-ups, including abdominal echo-tomography, confirmed the success of the treatment. CONCLUSION: The endovascular aortic aneurysm repair procedure in premature newborns may be considered when deciding treatment of this disease, and could avoid the risks associated with open surgery. However, follow-up and monitoring is required while the patient grows up, due to the possibility that the implanted stents require re-dilating. The outcomes of neonatal endovascular procedures in the future are unknown.",0,1603
765,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: A known long QT syndrome-related mutation in Nav1.5 cardiac channels (p.R1644H) was found in 4 members of a Spanish family but only 1 of them showed prolongation of the QT interval. In the other 3 relatives, a novel missense mutation in Cav1.2 cardiac channels was found (p.S1961N). Here, we functionally analyzed p.S1961N Cav1.2 channels to elucidate whether this mutation regulates the expressivity of the long QT syndrome phenotype in this family. METHODS: L-type calcium current (ICaL) recordings were performed by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in Chinese hamster ovary cells transiently transfected with native and/or p.S1961N Cav1.2 channels. RESULTS: Expression of p.S1961N channels significantly decreased ICaL density. Using Ba as a charge carrier to suppress the Ca-dependent inactivation of Cav1.2 channels, we demonstrated that the mutation significantly accelerates the voltage-dependent inactivation of Cav1.2 channels decreasing the inactivation time constant. As a consequence, the total charge flowing through p.S1961N Cav1.2 channels significantly decreased. The effects of the p.S1961N Cav1.2 and p.R1644H Nav1.5 mutations alone or their combination on the action potential (AP) morphology were simulated using a validated model of the human ventricular AP. The p.S1961N Cav1.2 mutation shortens the AP duration and abrogates the prolongation induced by p.R1644H Nav1.5 channels. CONCLUSIONS: The p.S1961N mutation in Cav1.2 channels decreased the ICaL, an effect which might shorten ventricular AP. The presence of the loss-of-function Cav1.2 mutation could functionally compensate the prolonging effects produced by the Nav1.5 gain-of-function mutation.",0,1716

767,"Two cases of children diagnosed with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism are presented. Case 1 developed an intestinal ileus at the age of five in the context of a respiratory problem. The tests performed confirmed metabolic acidosis, hyperchloraemia, hypokalaemia and nephrocalcinosis. Case 2 was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at the age of 11, and with RTA two years later. In both patients, the diagnosis of RTA was verified when decreased maximum urinary pCO2 was found. In case 2, a proximal bicarbonate leak (type 3 RTA) was also confirmed. This was the first case to be published on the topic. The causes of RTA in patients with hypothyroidism are reviewed. The deleterious effect on the kidneys may be due to the absence of thyroid hormone and/or autoantibodies in the cases of autoimmune hypothyroidism.",0,847
768,"Wild-type transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt) and degenerative aortic stenosis share a common demographic and clinical profile. It was recently suggested that some of the complications arising during and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) could be due to a co-existing cardiac amyloidosis. In a series of autopsies of patients who had undergone TAVR, researchers found ATTR amyloidosis in one third of the cases. A report is presented on two patients with aortic stenosis who were diagnosed with ATTRwt when they were about to undergo a TAVI. ATTRwt is a slowly progressing disease so we need to review the decisions on the therapeutic approach in these patients.",0,695

Hypertrichosis over the graft, causing an intraoral paratrichosis, might downgrade the quality of life and even require further interventions. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 58 year-old man, who developed hypertrichosis after surgery for tongue carcinoma. DISCUSSION: The therapeutic options, from choosing a graft from less hairy areas to laser depilation or de-epithelisation of the graft are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral paratrichosis is a serious complication that can produce dysphagia, nauseas, and vomiting, and can evolve into mal nutrition and produce an important decrease in life quality of our patients.",0,765
770,"We present a case report of a infective endocarditis by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum in a young patient eight years old with bicuspid aortic valve that led to a severe neurological embolism and death. Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum is part of the nasopharyngeal and skin flora. However, there are cases reported of endocarditis usually associated with immunocompromised patients that mostly presented a poor clinical outcome.",0,439
771,"We report the case of a breast cancer patient in whom a two-phase (18)F-sodium-fluoride ((18)F-NaF) bone PET/CT was useful for detecting hidden bone metastases and assessing treatment response. The patient underwent a two-phase bone PET/CT to evaluate a newly developed lesion found on bone scintigraphy following surgery. In the perfusion and bone phase PET/CT images, focally increased perfusion and bony uptake were found in the sacrum and L5 vertebra, suggesting bone metastases of breast cancer. Therefore, the patient subsequently underwent palliative treatment. In another twoPET/CT studies (each including two-phase bone images) performed after 3and 6months of follow-up, the perfusion phase images showed an improvement of the lesion uptake more clearly than in the bone phase images in the visual and semi-quantitative analyses, and thus the perfusion phase images were more useful for clarifying the treatment response earlier than the bone phase images. This is the first case showing the clinical usefulness of (18)F-NaF bone PET/CT with the perfusion imaging technique for evaluating bone metastases and the therapeutic response of metastatic bone lesions.",0,1170
772,"BACKGROUND: Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-linked disorder, and is characterised by a female phenotype in a chromosomally male individual. It usually occurs in puberty with primary amenorrhoea or as an inguinal tumour in a female infant. In recent years, it is often also diagnosed in fertility clinics in adulthood. OBJECTIVE: The case is presented of a pure seminoma in a woman with the reference diagnosis of inguinal hernia. CLINICAL CASE: A 53 year old woman, who was operated on in 2014 due to a nodule in left groin. Androgen insensitivity syndrome was corroborated, and histopathology reported it as a right testicular seminoma. DISCUSSION: The importance of early diagnosis is discussed, highlighting the consequences of misdiagnosis, and question whether these patients have been adequately treated in the past. The risk of malignant transformation of an undescended testicle increases with age, thus gonadectomy should be performed after puberty, and in some cases hormone replacement therapy.",0,1013

Simultaneous occurrence of these diseases is rare. In this paper, we reported the coexistence of sarcoidosis with FMF.",0,515
774,"We report a case of Ewing sarcoma localized in the prostate gland of a 33-year-old patient without bone or soft tissue involvement. Evidence of EWS and FLI1 gene translocation was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This is an unusual case with an interesting clinical presentation; indeed, only a few cases have been reported to date and not all have the supporting biological studies now considered essential for the diagnosis.",0,448
775,"Lipoblastoma is part of tumors derived from adipose tissue. It is a benign neoplasm that can be localized or diffuse, affecting children in early childhood and usually located in the trunk and extremities. These tumors are uncommon in the pediatric age, but when one of them is present, it is a challenge that we must resolve quickly due to the risk of malignancy that involves other similar neoplastic lesions. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult, because the imaging methods do not provide specific information that allows us to differentiate them from other tumors, such as liposarcomas. The definitive diagnosis is anatomopathological and, in doubtful cases, cytogenetic confirmation is necessary. We present the case of a 14-month-old boy with diagnosis of large sized lipoblastoma of retroperitoneal localization.",0,823
776,"Light chain-associated kidney compromise is frequent in patients with monoclonal gammopathies; it affects the glomeruli or the tubules, and its most common cause is multiple myeloma. It may develop after a kidney transplant due to recurrence of a preexisting multiple myeloma or it can be a de novo disease manifesting as graft dysfunction and proteinuria. A kidney biopsy is always necessary to confirm the diagnosis.We describe three cases of kidney graft dysfunction due to multiple myeloma in patients without presence of the disease before the transplant.",0,560
777,"Although the number of lung transplants in Spain is increasing annually, more organs are required to ease waiting lists. Controlled non-heart beating donors (NHBD) (Maastricht III) are a reality at international level, and contribute significantly to increasing donor numbers. In this study, we present our NHBD protocol and the initial experience in Spain using lung grafts from this type of donor. Three bilateral lung transplants were performed between January 2012 and December 2014. Preservation was by ex-vivo lung perfusion in 2 cases and by traditional cold ischemia in the other. None of the patients developed grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, no in-hospital mortality was recorded and 1-year survival was 100%. These initial results, and international experience, should help to develop similar protocols to encourage the use of controlled non-heart beating donors.",0,877
778,"We report the case of a 13-year-old patient who complains of an acute superior visual field scotoma in the last 48hours. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. The right eye fundus examination revealed torsion of a prepapillary loop in the inferior branch of the retinal artery, associated with a arterial vascular attenuation and whitenning of the inferior retina that involved both nasal and temporal branches but spared the foveal region. During the follow-up the vascular loop dissapeared and only glial tissue was seen in front of the optic nerve head. BCVA remained 20/20 in both eyes. This report shows the evolution of the vascular loop after an occlusion. The absence of blood flow produces a collapse of the arterial walls, in time the vascular loop is replaced by glial tissue.",0,809
779,"Galactosialidosis (OMIM #256540) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the CTSA gene, which encodes the protective protein cathepsin A. The loss of function of this protein causes a secondarily deficiency of beta-galactosidase and N-acetyl-a-neuraminidase enzymes activities. We describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular analysis of a case report with a phenotype compatible with the late infantile form. The biochemical analysis reveled deficiencies of beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase activities in dried blood spot and fibroblasts and the molecular study showed two missense mutations in the CTSA gene: a previously reported mutation, p.Arg441Cys (c.1321C>T), and a novel mutation, p.His475Pro (c.1424 A>C), located in exons 14 and 15, respectively.",0,801
780,"Sternal tumours are rare in children. The differential diagnoses include a wide spectrum of benign (from bone cyst to osteoblastoma, osteochondroma and fibrous displasia) and malignant tumours (Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma), inflammatory lesions and infectious processes. The SELSTOC (Self Limiting Sternal Tumours of Childhood) are entities of non-specific origin, they are self-limiting and characterised by a rapidly growing tumour that disappears spontaneously with no history of trauma or active infection. The onset of a rapidly growing mass with no preceding trauma is worrying to parents who then consult the health professionals. Soft tissue ultrasound enables us to characterise these lesions and define their nature in relation to the adjacent tissues. Chest x-ray and MRI can also help to characterise these lesions. In this paper we present two case reports of children referred to our department for characterisation of sternal tumours.",0,970

The Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome can develop in immunosuppressed hosts, mainly in those with depression of cellular immunity. Co-infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a risk factor for the development of severe forms of strongyloidiasis. We present the case of a 50-year-old man with Strongyloides hyperinfection and coinfection with HTLV. The diagnosis was delayed owing to its unusual epidemiology and an initial suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. Identification of the parasite in bronchioalveolar lavage and duodenal and colonic mucosa biopsies confirmed the diagnosis.

The main entities that should be contemplated in the differential diagnosis in such cases are in-transit and regional lymph node metastases. We describe 2 cases of women with breast implants who developed palpable subcutaneous lesions in the axillary region during follow-up of melanoma. In both cases, the ultrasound study showed diffuse hyperechoic signals forming the characteristic snowstorm sign in the subcutaneous tissue. Ultrasound proved to be a key diagnostic tool for ruling out melanoma-related disease, such as in-transit metastases and regional lymph node metastases.",0,662
783,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bexarotene is a synthetic selective X receptor rexinoide approved for the systemic treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. During treatment is very frequent the occurrence of hypothyroidism and severe mixed hyperlipidemia, both are reversibles and dose-dependent adverse events. Increase of triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol level (up to even higher levels have been associated with pancreatitis in some cases) is widely described (as is the case with other retinoids) but decrease in HDL-cholesterol is poored know. We review our experience with the use of bexarotene. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a serie of 3 clinical report of patients treated with bexarotene in whose, in addition to these well-known adverse event, a serious lowering of HDL-cholesterol was observed. RESULTS: The 3 patients studied had metabolic complications like central hypothyroidism and severe mixed hyperlipidemia; with special emphasis on the sharp fall (mean decrease>83%) in the HDL-cholesterol level. Cholesterol lowering medication and substitutive hormonal replacement with levotiroxine resulted in an improvement of the biochimical parameters without reaching the correct goals. CONCLUSIONS: Bexarotene produce as predictable side effects severe mixed hyperlipidemia with marked decrease in HDL-cholesterol levels and central hypothyroidism, being the both reversible and dose-dependent. A reflection on the possible aetiological mechanisms and implications of this phenomenon are included.",0,1506

786,"BACKGROUND: Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), also known as Rogers syndrome, is characterized by megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural hearing loss, and diabetes mellitus. Disturbances of the thiamine transport into the cells results from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC19A2 gene. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a girl which presented with sensorineural deafness treated with a hearing prosthesis, insulin requiring diabetes, macrocytic anemia, treated with thiamine (100 mg/day). Hemoglobin level improved to 12.1 g/dl after dose of thiamine therapy increased up to 200 mg/day. CONCLUSION: Patients with TRMA must be evaluated for megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural hearing loss, and diabetes mellitus. They must be followed for response of hematologic and diabetic after thiamine therapy. It should be kept in mind that dose of thiamine therapy may be increased according to the clinical response. Genetic counseling should be given.",0,981

788,Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase and that causes very severe symptoms. Attacks may be triggered by a series of drugs and by other factors that the anesthesiologist should be aware of in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our objective is to review anesthetic considerations in acute intermittent porphyria. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria who was scheduled for knee arthroscopy. The anesthetic technique used was a femoral and sciatic nerve block under sedation with an infusion of remifentanil. The surgery proceeded without incident and the patient was discharged home after 24h. We consider the use of a peripheral plexus block of the lower limb to have been the safest anesthetic technique for this patient.,0,860
789,"Myiasis is an infestation of tissues and organs of humans and animals by Diptera larvae (flies, horseflies, mosquitoes). They are located at different body sites, and classified clinically as cutaneous, visceral and cavitary. We report a 26-year-old woman with a history of seborrheic dermatitis and recent trip to Brazil. She presented with a seven days history of suppurating wounds in the parieto-occipital area of the scalp. At physical examination we found three ulcers of approximately 1.5 cm each, with multiple mobile larvae inside. The obtained larvae were analyzed, identifying Cochliomyia hominivorax larvae at L2 and L3 stages. The patient was managed successfully with oral antimicrobials and local cleansing.

February 2013, an elderly man, who visited Pakistan and KSA, was confirmed as MRS-CoV in UK. A team visited Mirpur to assess current and past SARI trends in major indoor facilities, to explore possible contact of the patient with known or suspected SARI case during his stay in Pakistan and enlist close contacts. METHODS: Review of indoor records in hospitals, interviews with relatives & physicians and active contact tracing using operational case definition. RESULTS: Arrived on 16th December 2012, mostly stayed at daughter's house, visited by relatives, on 19th January, left for KSA accompanied by daughter, developed fever with chills and body aches on 23rd January. On 28th January, arrived London, admitted at City Hospital, Birmingham, subsequently shifted to Manchester Hospital on 6th February 2013, diagnosed as MERS-CoV, expired on 19th February. His son having underlying condition, confirmed as MERS-CoV on 13th February, and expired on 17th February. Daughter developed mild respiratory symptoms, confirmed as MERS-CoV on 16th Feb and recovered. Both have been infected by the Index case. The review of indoor record did not reveal any significant change in SARI trends, the cumulative number of cases for the January -February 2012 and 2013 was 291 and 294 respectively indicating no difference. During his stay in Pakistan, he didn't meet any suspected/ill person. Close contacts were observed and investigated for MERS-CoV, all remained healthy. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence does not suggest any MERS-CoV transmission to, or from the patient in Pakistan.",1,1705
791,"Liver hemangiomas are the most common benign primary tumors of the liver. Due to their high prevalence, incidental finding of hemangiomas during radiological workup of oncologic patients is not uncommon. We present the case of a patient diagnosed of an ovarian immature teratoma and hepatic lesions with typical radiological appearance of hemangiomas that decreased in size during adjuvant chemotherapy with BEP regimen (cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin). Chemotherapy-induced shrinkage of hepatic hemangiomas can mimic the response of liver metastases to chemotherapy and may induce erroneous interpretations. The purpose of this report is to describe a chemotherapy-induced response of liver hemangiomas, especially when BEP combination is used. To date this observation has been barely reported in the literature and, to our knowledge, this is the first documented case of chemotherapy-induced response of liver hemangiomas in a patient diagnosed of an ovarian immature teratoma.",0,984

OBJECTIVE: To describe a girl infected with HIV who presented Fanconi syndrome during antiretroviral therapy with TDF. CLINICAL CASE: We describe a HIV-1-infected girl, who after 18 months treatment with TDF presented loss of strength and pain of the lower extremities with functional impairment. Laboratory findings were consistent with Fanconi syndrome. Radiographs showed bilateral hip fracture and wrists. Full recovery of Fanconi syndrome was achieved four months after changing antiretroviral therapy.

793,"BACKGROUND: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a rare tumour, usually occurring in paediatric ages, and mainly located in the posterior fossa. It can cause hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension and, less frequently, seizures, or a focal neurological deficit. The main imaging study by magnetic resonance imaging, which shows a tumour with solid and cystic components without peri-lesional swelling. The election treatment is surgical, and the patient is considered cured if a total resection is accomplished. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of 22-year-old female patient with a supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma and epilepsy. Histopathology reported a low grade glial proliferation, with an extensive fibrillar matrix, small cells without atypia, extensive calcifications and piloid areas consisting of bipolar fusiform cells, and some Rosenthal fibres. There were also spongiotic areas consisting of multipolar cells and associated microcysts. The final report was a pilocytic astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Pilocytic astrocytoma is more frequent in paediatric patients and in the posterior fossa. The case presented is of a young female adult with supratentorial location, making it a special case. The surgery achieved a total resection. The long-term prognosis is good, but it is necessary to perform a follow-up, particularly in adult patients because of a higher risk of recurrence.",0,1387
794,"INTRODUCTION: Over recent years, several types of freezing of gait (FOG) have been described, mainly according to their response to levodopa. FOG in Parkinson's disease presents in a variety of ways due to differences within the underlying pathophysiology. In a number of patients, increasing the dopaminergic stimulation may not improve this condition, and may even worsen it. CASE REPORTS: We present two patients with Parkinson's disease who were evaluated during off, on and supra-on periods. Motor function was assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III, tapping test on lower limbs and quantification of FOG episodes during each of these periods. Both patients presented FOG episodes while in off period, experiencing a significant improvement during on period. However, when increasing the dopaminergic stimulation in order to try to improve their motor response, FOG episodes worsened to the point of impairing gait. CONCLUSIONS: FOG episodes are not always a consequence of akinesia or rigidity. Regarding the pathophysiology, the lack of an appropriate response to treatment would be explained by the involvement of structures exceeding the substantia nigra and the dopaminergic deficit. FOG worsening during periods of dopaminergic overstimulation could be related to a neurotransmitters disbalance affecting other nuclei involved in postural and gait control.",0,1387
795,"Differentiating between the cases of megaureter that require surgery and the ones in whom treatment can be delayed is challenging. A large number of surgical techniques for the treatment of POM been proposed aiming mainly to reduce renal damage by relieving the affected ureter. Resection of the affected ureteral segment followed by vesicoureteral reimplantation either with or without reduction ureteroplasty is the classic treatment, however posing a high rate of complications when performed in patients aged less than one year. Endoscopic techniques have also been described to avoid external diversion. Recently, refluxing ureteral reimplantation has been proposed as a temporary treatment for patients with POM. OBJECTIVE: To describe the ureteral meatotomy technique as an alternative to the refluxing ureteral reimplantation for POM in patients aged less than one year. METHOD: Retrospective study of patients with POM undergoing ureteral meatotomy, aiming to temporarily relieve the ureter. The procedure consists of a 1.5 cm-long cut made with scissors on the upper edge of the ureteral ostium at the 12 o'clock position, until the dilated portion of the ureter was found and abundant urine drainage was observed. The edges of the incision were sutured, joining together the ureteral mucosa and the bladder mucosa. RESULT: From 2011 to 2015, three patients with POM underwent ureteral meatotomy, with four renal units treated altogether. None of the patients presented complications and, as a sign of obstruction relief, all showed reduced dilatation at the ultrasound. No patient had complications. CONCLUSIONS: Ureteral meatotomy is a safe and effective technique in the initial treatment of POM in patients aged less than one year.",0,1745

798,"BACKGROUND: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disease characterised by the autonomous production of parathyroid hormone. The most common cause is an adenoma, followed by hyperplasia, and rarely carcinoma. CLINICAL CASES: Three cases are presented. The first case is associated with a brown tumour that was diagnosed as hyperplasia after study and surgery. The second case was related to pathological fractures, and a lower right adenoma 236 times bigger than a normal parathyroid was excised. The last case presented with abdominal pain and heartburn. Histopathology reported a carcinoma, which was removed using surgery en bloc. All patients have improved. CONCLUSION: Hyperparathyroidism symptoms are very difficult to identify and diagnose, thus a detailed and broad approach is needed when hyperparathyroidism is suspected.",0,826
799,"Congenital fibre type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare type of myopathy that is characterised by muscle weakness and hypotonia during childhood. Clinical features include motor delay, feeding difficulties, limb weakness, joint contractures, and scoliosis. A report is presented of the anaesthetic management of a 3-year-old girl with CFTD myopathy associated with a mutation of the TPM3 gene, scheduled for adenotonsillectomy because of obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). The main concerns were the possible susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, the risk of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis, a greater sensitivity to non-depolarising muscle relaxants, and the presence of OSAHS. Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and the use of rocuronium/sugammadex appear to be safe options. Given the high risk of respiratory compromise and other complications, patients should be closely monitored in the post-operative period.",0,946
800,"INTRODUCTION: Cysts of the bile duct or choledochal cysts are rare diseases in our area. The aetiology is unknown, with the most accepted hypothesis being a pancreatobiliary maljunction anomaly. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical data, diagnosis and treatment of a number of patients with choledochal cyst, as well as presenting an update on this condition. METHOD: A retrospective descriptive study was performed on paediatric patients diagnosed with choledochal cyst in the last 20 years in a tertiary hospital. CASE REPORTS: A total of 4 choledochal cyst cases in childhood, predominantly female, are pre- sented. The most frequent reason for consultation was vomiting, and presenting with jaundice and choluria in all cases. Patients with choledochal cyst were classified as type I in 3 cases, and one case of type IVa. In all cases surgical treatment was performed; any patient had complications to date. CONCLUSIONS: Cysts of the bile ducts have a low prevalence. The treatment of choice is surgical, requiring close monitoring due to the risk of cholangiocarcinoma.",0,1072

804,"Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM) is a rare and emerging entity of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). They have been associated with connective tissue disorders, viral infections, malignancy, anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) and anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase protein (with or without the use of statins). Anti-SRP associated NAM has different clinical and histological characteristics that differentiate them from other IIM, resulting in a poor prognosis. Very few cases treated with rituximab have been published, with varying clinical response. Here we describe a case of anti-SRP associated NAM refractory to conventional immunosuppressants and its successful long-term management with the combination of rituximab, corticosteroids and methotrexate.",0,790
805,We report the case of a 75-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia. He had a history of solitary fibrous tumor diagnosed by Pathology after its complete surgical resection eight years before. The laboratory examination reported hypoglycemia with inhibited Insulin secretion. A computed tomography of the thorax revealed a large solid heterogeneous mass in the left hemithorax. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare neoplasm. The association of solitary fibrous tumor and paraneoplastic hypoglycemia is known as Doege-Potter syndrome and occurs in less than 5% of all solitary fibrous tumors.,0,629
806,CLINICAL CASE: A 63-year-old man presents with late hypotony maculopathy after non-penetrating deep sclerectomy. Hypotonia and visual acuity are improved after transconjunctival suturing of the scleral flap. DISCUSSION: Hypotony maculopathy may occur as a late complication after glaucoma surgery. Transconjunctival suturing of the scleral flap can be useful when conservative measures have failed.,0,398
807,"BACKGROUND: Non-traumatic spontaneous rupture of the biliary tract and retroperitoneal accumulation (retroperitoneal biloma) is an extremely rare condition. CLINICAL CASE: A 57 year-old woman with no known biliary disease, started with intense pain in the right abdomen 30 days prior to consultation. She also had jaundice (4+). The initial hepatobiliary ultrasound reported choledocholithiasis and retroperitoneal fluid collection, which was confused with a peri-renal abscess. Guided puncture was performed and the presence of bile was evident. Dilation of the bile duct was observed in the computed tomography. The patient underwent laparotomy to correct both conditions. CONCLUSION: The retroperitoneal biloma, also called choleretroperitoneum, is of multifactorial origin. Clinical presentation is non-specific, with diffuse abdominal distension and pain in all patients. The diagnosis is made based on ultrasonography and computed tomography, and can even be diagnosed intra-operatively. The treatment is based on liquid bile drainage and correction of the leak.",0,1068

Classical presentation is characterized by palpable purpura, glomerulonephritis, arthralgias and abdominal pain. Although genitourinary manifestations, in form of testicular and scrotal involvement, have been widely described, penile involvement remains an extremely rare complication. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with purpuric rash on the glans, prepuce and penile shaft, with painful edema in the penile region. He also had a 3-days history of fever, palpable purpuric rash on the buttocks and lower extremities along with right wrist pain.

We report a 59 year old female with weight loss, fever, dyspnea and cough of several months of duration. She had a cavitated mass in lung imaging. A positive conventional PCR lead to the diagnosis of tuberculosis, but she had negative smears and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient did not respond to treatment and her clinical condition worsened. A peripheral lymph node biopsy confirmed the presence of a diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Bone marrow pathology showed non caseating granulomas, again with negative microbiological tests for M. tuberculosis. Findings in the bone marrow were interpreted as a secondary sarcoid reaction to cancer and PCR results as a false positive. The lymphoma was treated, achieving complete remission. This case highlights the importance of the differential diagnosis between these two entities.",0,1017
813,"The FATCO syndrome, (Fibular Aplasia, Tibial Campomelia and Oligosyndactyly) are bone malformations with main alteration in lower limbs. It is a rare entity and there are few cases reported in international literature, and so far there are not published cases in Colombia. Here we present a case of a male newborn with prenatal and postnatal signs consistent with FATCO syndrome without other organs malformations, and there is a brief discussion about this syndrome and other different malformations associated with it.",0,520
814,"Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal disease of mast cell progenitors from the bone marrow. The clinical picture varies from asymptomatic forms (indolent) to a highly aggressive form with a very short (mast cell leukemia) survival. Between 28-34% of patients with SM are related to bone condition at the time of diagnosis and 16% have symptomatic fractures. The presentation of SM as clinical vertebral fractures in young men is rare. Here, we describe a case of established osteoporosis as the only manifestation of SM.",0,522
815,Dystrophic calcification in gastric carcinoma is an unusual finding usually associated with mucinous carcinomas. Psammomatous calcification is rare; indeed there are only seven cases reported to date. We present a case of a 73 year old male with tubular adenocarcinoma that revealed numerous globular shaped calcified bodies of psammomatous type within the tumor. The pathogenesis and prognostic significance are discussed.,0,423
816,"Twiddler's syndrome is a rare complication associated with implantable electrical stimulation devices. First described in a patient with a pacemaker, it is a known complication in the field of cardiology. However, it is not so recognised in the world of neurosurgery, in which it has been described in relation to deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices. Characterised by manipulating either consciously or unconsciously the generator of such devices, which causes it to rotate on itself, the syndrome causes the coiling of the wiring of these systems and can lead to their rupture or the displacement of intracranial electrodes. We describe a case of twiddler's syndrome in a patient treated with DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which clinical deterioration presented after a good initial response. Control radiographs revealed rotation of the wiring system and displacement of the intracranial electrodes.",0,914
817,"CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old boy presented with right eye proptosis and lateral dystopia. A soft non-pulsatile mass was found in the superomedial orbital region. An excisional biopsy was performed, for which the histopathology reported an epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. DISCUSSION: Haemangioendothelioma is a borderline vascular lesion within the spectrum of clinically benign and malignant tumours. These can arise from soft tissue or bone. There are few reports of these tumours located in the orbit.",0,504
818,"OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of renal hemorrhage after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and their therapeutic management. METHODS: Description of the clinical cases, together with the diagnosis and therapeutic management of these complications. RESULTS: We present two cases of patients with renal hemorrhage after ESWL, which were performed without immediate complications. One of the cases, after detecting an important laceration of the renal parenchyma, needed two embolization sessions for its short-term resolution; however, the patient finally passed away due to the complications derived from hemorrhage. The other case was solved through conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Even though hemorrhage is an infrequent complication after ESWL, it should be suspected when the patient presents compatible clinical symptoms, since even though most cases are resolved in a conservative manner, on some occasions specific treatments for the hemorrhage are necessary. Old age and the presence of vascular comorbidities seem to be related to a higher risk of hemorrhage after ESWL.",0,1095
819,"Arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis syndrome is a rare lethal disorder that involves multipl organ system. It is inherited autosomal recessive and caused by defects in the VPS33B and VIPAR genes. Three cardinal findings of this syndrome are arthrogryposis, renal tubular dysfunction and cholestasis.The other organ involvements including ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, congenital heart defects and severe failure to thrive are sometimes associated with this syndrome. Clinical findings, organ biopsy and mutational analysis can help for diagnosing but there is no curative treatment except supportive care. Several symptoms of this condition are already usually present in the neonatal period: arthrogryposis, neonatal cholestasis, skin lesions, among others. Usually survival is until the first year of life. We present a newborn whose evolution was rapidly fatal.",0,912
820,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that common human coronavirus might be neurotropic, although it was first isolated as a pathogen of the respiratory tract. We noticed that a few patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experienced central nervous symptoms during the course of illness. In the present study, we isolated a SARS coronavirus strain from a brain tissue specimen obtained from a patient with SARS with significant central nervous symptoms. METHODS: Using transmission electronic microscopy and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the causative pathogen was identified in cultures of a brain tissue specimen obtained from the patient with SARS. Histopathologic examination of the brain tissue was performed using the methods of immunohistochemistry analysis and double immunofluorescence staining. Fifteen cytokines and chemokines were detected in the blood of the patient with SARS by means of a bead-based multiassay system. RESULTS: A fragment specific for SARS human coronavirus was amplified from cultures of the brain suspension, and transmission electronic microscopy revealed the presence of an enveloped virus morphologically compatible with a coronavirus isolated in the cultures. Pathologic examination of the brain tissue revealed necrosis of neuron cells and broad hyperplasia of gliocytes. Immunostaining demonstrated that monokine induced by interferon- gamma (Mig) was expressed in gliocytes with the infiltration of CD68+ monocytes/macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes in the brain mesenchyme. Cytokine/chemokine assay revealed that levels of interferon- gamma -inducible protein 10 and Mig in the blood were highly elevated, although the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were close to normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides direct evidence that SARS human coronavirus is capable of infecting the central nervous system, and that Mig might be involved in the brain immunopathology of SARS.",1,1966
821,"A four year old patient with no medical history was admitted to our hospital's Emergency Department, suffering from edema and hypertension. During physical examination a low pulse was detected in the left arm and a lack of pulses in lower limbs, with a blood pressure difference greater than 10 mm Hg between both arms. An echocardiogram demonstrated severe aortic abdominal coarctation and ventricular dysfunction. Takayasu arteritis was diagnosed and cardiac angiography was performed. Disconnection of left subclavian artery and severe tightness at the abdominal aorta were confirmed. The definitive diagnosis was Takayasu arteritis. Angioplasty with stent was performed in abdominal aorta, with good subsequent results. The pulses improved in the lower limbs, and normal blood pressure values without gradient between all members were registered. The echocardiogram improved ventricular function and the gradient in the coarctation area was significantly reduced.",0,967
822,"INTRODUCTION: Fasciola hepatica is a parasite of the class Trematoda. It commonly has been found in developing countries. When it infects humans is characterized by a triad of fever, pain in right upper quadrant and peripheral eosinophilia. We present a 67-year-old female from a rural town of the north of Lima, Peru, it was found abdominal pain, eosinophilia and focal hepatic lesions. For this reason, a hepatic mass was the initial suspicion. The hepatic biopsy was performed and one of the findings was eosinophilia. Fasciola hepatica infection should be considered as part of differential diagnosis in hepatic tumors with eosinophilia when the origin of the patient is from endemic areas of F. hepatica.",0,709
823,"Tuberculosis in infants is a clinical case difficult to diagnose by regular testing which often yield negative results; additionally, the source of transmission is difficult to identify. This work presents the case of a one-month old nursing boy presenting irritability, tachypnea, fever, poor gain weight from birth, and hepatomegaly. Additionally, he had the maternal history of pre-extensively drug- resistant tuberculosis and tuberculoid granulomatosis reaction with positive auramine tincture for acid-alcohol resistant bacilli at histopathology of the placenta. With a suspected congenital tuberculosis, he was referred to the National Children's Health Institute for diagnosis and treatment. The patient showed a favorable clinical evolution and no adverse reactions to treatment. The diagnosis of congenital tuberculosis must be considered in infants with suggestive clinical signs of the disease and such suspicion must be maintained with the presence of a maternal history of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.",0,1023
824,"Heliox, a helium-oxygen gas mixture, has been used for many decades to treat obstructive pulmonary disease. The lower density and higher viscosity of heliox relative to nitrogen-oxygen mixtures can significantly reduce airway resistance when an anatomic upper air-flow obstruction is present and gas flow is turbulent. Clinically, heliox can decrease airway resistance in acute asthma in adults and children and in COPD. Heliox may also enhance the bronchodilating effects of beta-agonist administration for acute asthma. Respiratory syndromes caused by coronavirus infections in humans range in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with human coronavirus OC43 and other viral strains. In infants, coronavirus infection can cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in variable combinations and can produce enough air-flow obstruction to cause respiratory failure. We describe a case of coronavirus OC43 infection in an infant with severe acute respiratory distress treated with heliox inhalation to avoid intubation.",1,1063
825,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) associated with sphincterotomy is a useful procedure that is widely used in cases of choledocholithiasis and bile duct obstruction. In spite of being a safe test, there is a risk of complications like pancreatitis, haemorrhaging or perforation. Post-ERCP duodenal perforation is a rare event but has serious consequences if it is not treated early. The lesion mechanism, the place and extension of the perforation, as well as the clinical picture and radiographic findings will guide patient management, which must be individualised and constantly reevaluated. Its mortality is closely related to diagnostic and therapeutic delay. In those cases where a conservative attitude is adopted, close vigilance will be maintained facing the possibility of a worsening of the clinical picture and a change in its management.",0,870
826,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the upper limb is a rare entity, estimated to account for 10% of all cases of DVT. Classically, they are classified into primary (idiopathic, due to subclavian vein compression or exercise related) and secondary (cancer, thrombophilia, trauma, shoulder surgery, associated to venous catheters or due to hormonal causes). The Paget- Schrotter syndrome is a primary thrombosis of the subclavian vein in the subclavian-axillary junction, related either to repetitive movements or to exercise; leading to microtrauma in the endothelium with consequent activation of the coagulation cascade. Clinically, it presents abruptly with pain, edema and feeling of heaviness in the affected limb. The treatment varies from thrombolytics and anticoagulation to surgical intervention, depending on the time of evolution. We present four cases of exercise-related subclavian vein thrombosis.",0,905
827,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy is a rare disease in children. Clinical manifestations include headache, seizures, visual disturbances and altered consciousness associated with typical magnetic resonance images of the nervous system. The syndrome usually manifests in patients with eclampsia, solid organ transplantation, haematologic, renal and autoimmune diseases among other less common causes and it is often triggered after a hypertensive crisis or use of immunosuppressive drugs. Less common pathogenic factors as blood transfusion, use of immunoglobulins or an underlying infection can be associated. In this case a girl with systemic lupus erythematosus and exposed to multiple etiopathogenic factors developed posterior reversible encephalopathy.",0,759
828,"Orbital adult-onset xanthogranuloma is a rare idiopathic inflammatory disorder included in the group of orbital xanthogranulomatous diseases with possible systemic associations. A 43 year-old woman presented with a deep fast-growing mass on the right upper eyelid. She had a past medical history of bilateral non-ulcerative nodules on the upper eyelid and two cosmetic upper lid blepharoplasties. An excisional biopsy was performed and the histopathology analysis confirmed the diagnosis of adult histiocytic xanthogranuloma. The systemic work up was negative and the patient is asymptomatic without treatment. Orbital xanthogranulomatous diseases are rare, but potentially life-threatening disorders. The ophthalmologist must be aware of this disease in order to make an early diagnosis using the anamnesis, clinical examination, and histology of the periocular lesions that may resemble palpebral xanthelasmas.",0,912
829,"Thoracic duct cysts in the mediastinum are extremely rare; they can give rise to chylothorax when they spontaneously rupture or after they are operated on. We present the case of an adult woman with a thoracic duct cyst in the mediastinum and chylothorax from its spontaneous rupture; to our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been specifically reported before. We describe the clinical and radiological findings, the therapeutic management, and the pathology findings, reviewing the literature for this entity.",0,511
830,"CASE REPORT: The case involves a 22-year-old woman who presented with headache and decreased vision. She showed asymmetric papilledema, and a 6-mm tonsillar descent was observed in the image tests. She was diagnosed with secondary intracranial hypertension coinciding with the symptoms of a Chiari malformation (MC). DISCUSSION: Chiari malformation type I is the most common in this group of malformations, and is characterized by a greater than 5mm descent of the tonsils, being able to cause increased intracranial pressure and papilledema by blocking the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. In this case, the MC was not the responsible for triggering the secondary intracranial hypertension, but a mere coincidence of both processes.",0,733
831,"Horner syndrome is characterized by the following triad of clinical signs: miosis, ptosis and facial anhidrosis. In addition, iris heterochromia, conjunctival injection, facial erythema, congestive nasal mucosa and apparent enophthalmos secondary to the reduction of the palpebral fissure can appear. It is caused by an interruption of the sympathetic pathway that extends from the hypothalamus to the orbit. Because there is no decussation, the signs are homolateral to the lesion. Traditionally, it is classified as congenital and acquired. Occasionally, it is associated with neoplasias such as neuroblastoma. It remains controversial what imaging studies should be requested as a protocolized workup of this neurological syndrome in a patient. We report the case of a 45-day-old infant with congenital Horner syndrome.",0,822
832,"INTRODUCTION: Hypothermia treatment has improved the prognosis of asphyxiated neonates. Widely used, it has demonstrated to be safe without severe side effects. The aim of this article is to review the incidence of stridor amongst asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia in our unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of our patients. RESULTS: Stridor was presented in 7/75 (9.3%) of patients during hypothermia. Three received whole body hypothermia, 3 selective cerebral, and in one case both techniques were used. All cases required increased respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: Different mechanisms may be responsible for the appearance of stridor in patients with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). In our series the incidence of stridor was similar for the two hypothermia devices. To better understand these possible side effects of hypothermia, further prospective studies (which should include laryngoscopy) are needed.",0,939
833,"Mammary pathology is infrequent during childhood. It is rare the probability of finding a breast mass in an infant. The most frequent possible diagnoses at this age are breast abscess, mastitis, breast engorgement due to maternal hormonal stimulation and hemangioma. Reaching the proper diagnosis is essential in order to apply a suitable treatment and avoid the potential disease complications. We present the case of a female infant having a mass in the right breast from birth. Initially the entity was treated as mastitis. Nevertheless, the bad evolution made necessary considering the differential diagnosis. It was concluded to be a hemangioma. Due to the lesion ulceration and the potential risk of developing breast hypoplasia, treatment with propranolol was started. The tumor was almost completely resolved.",0,817
834,"Olmesartan is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. Several cases of sprue-like enteropathy associated with the use of this drug have been described which, even with important signs and limitations for the patient, present a full recovery after discontinuing the use of olmesartan. The case of a 64 year-old patient is presented, diagnosed with hypertension, under treatment with olmesartan-amlodipine, with chronic diarrhoea and villous atrophy on intestinal biopsies without diagnostic criteria for celiac disease and with complete remission after suspending discontinuing the use of olmesartan. Based on the clinical features presented by the case reported, the clinical and anatomopathological findings are described as well as the evolution of drug-induced enteropathy.",0,826
835,UNLABELLED: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a heterogeneous disease of unknown etiology characterized by proliferation of Langerhans cells. It is a rare disease. Bone involvement is common but vertebral disease is rare. We present a 4 year old patient with abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms. Magnetic resonance showed vertebra plana in D9 with involvement of paravertebral soft tissues. The child underwent surgery for decompression and biopsy. Biopsy confirmed Langerhans cell histiocytosis. She was treated with vinblastine and prednisone during 6 months following LCH-III with complete recovery of neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSION: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a differential diagnosis in a radiograph with vertebra plana or collapse of vertebral body.,0,764
836,Hydatid disease is a parasitic infection whose etiologic agent is Echinococcus granulosus. Human is an accidental intermediate host and the most common site is the liver. The brain involvement is unusual and up to 75% of cases are described in the pediatric population. We present six children with cerebral hydatid disease admitted to the Pediatric Hospital J.P. Garrahan. All had neurological involvement on admission. The images showed single cystic lesion in the brain. They did not present involvement in other organs. Serology was negative in all cases. Medical and surgical treatment in all cases. The clinical outcome was favorable without sequelae in five of them and one had a residual paresis right faciobrachiocrural. This infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic tumor lesions of the central nervous system.,0,850
837,"Operational tolerance (absence of allograft rejection and good outcome without immunosuppression) has been object of intense research in pediatric liver transplant in the last years. The morbidity and mortality related to long-term immunosuppressive treatment of these patients are well known. We report a case of operational tolerance of our unit in a pediatric liver transplant recipient who is immunosuppressant-free since 16 month after transplant after progressive withdrawal related to asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus first infection. He has good histological, clinical and serological outcome after 22 month of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first operational tolerance reported case in our country after liver transplant in a pediatric recipient and we believe that the study of these patients is important in order to detect characteristics that allow to identify a potentially tolerant group in which it is possible to withdraw immunosuppressive drugs.",0,972
838,"McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome is caused by chronic water and electrolyte hypersecretion from an intestinal tumor, usually a villous adenoma, located in the rectum or sigmoid. Patients often have dehydration, hypovolemic shock and kidney failure associated with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia and metabolic acidosis. We report a 62-year-old male, suffering chronic diarrhea for eight years who was admitted after a syncope. He had severe hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia and acute renal failure. After his metabolic disorders were corrected, a colonoscopy showed a large rectosigmoid tumor with the characteristics of a villous adenoma. During the follow up after the complete tumor resection, the patient has remained asymptomatic.",0,766
839,"CASE REPORT: A case is presented of a 4 week-old female neonate with Peters anomaly (PA) and unilateral persistent foetal vasculature (PFV) referred to our centre due to esotropia. At 12 weeks of age, a penetrating keratoplasty and vitrectomy were performed without major complications in the immediate post-operative period. The patient is currently under an intensive treatment for amblyopia and secondary glaucoma. DISCUSSION: Surgical treatment of PFV is controversial, with prevention of amblyopia, phthisis, and glaucoma being the main reasons for it. Patients with unilateral PFV and type II PA could be good candidates for this combined surgical procedure.",0,664
840,"Bipolar disorder is one of the most common, severe and persistent mental disorders. The evaluation of all data and variables related to bipolar disorder is a difficult task, because there is no clear agreement on what should be included in this category. One of the traditional treatments for this disease is the lithium metal that is administered in the form of lithium salt. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window and there is a significant risk of complications arising from its use, mainly neurological and renal. In the case presented, the preparation of a care plan is described for a patient diagnosed with bipolar disorder who suffered a complication with lithium treatment. To do this, it was decided to use a standardized care plan and later completed it with diagnostic, objectives and interventions to the specific needs of the patient, aimed at achieving optimal levels of independence.",0,900
841,"INTRODUCTION: Convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH) is a rare type of spontaneous, non-traumatic, and nonaneurysmal SAH characterised by blood collections in one or more cortical sulci in the convexity of the brain; the aetiology varies. We report a clinical case series of 3 patients with cSAH associated with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) who presented with focal sensory seizures and responded well to corticosteroid treatment. PATIENTS: Case 1 was a 67-year-old man reporting right-sided paroxysmal sensory episodes with Jacksonian progression, cheiro-oral symptoms, and motor dysphasia. Case 2 was a 79-year-old man reporting left-sided paroxysmal episodes with cheiro-oral signs and dysarthria. Case 3 was a 71-year-old woman also reporting recurrent left cheiro-oral signs and dysarthria. None of the patients had headache or clinical dementia. Aneurysms were ruled out using MR angiography. RESULTS: Brain CT scan detected an isolated hyperintensity in a sulcus of the frontal convexity; brain gradient echo T2-weighted MRI sequences showed meningeal haemosiderosis and microbleeds. However, no atrophy was identified in medial temporal lobes including the hippocampal formation. All patients had low levels of beta-amyloid in CSF, low values on the Hulstaert index and high levels of phosphorylated tau protein. Patients were initially treated with prednisone and levetiracetam, but symptoms recurred in 2 patients after prednisone was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: We present a series of 3 patients with cSAH associated with CAA, characterised by a stereotypical syndrome responding well to corticoid treatment; there were no cases of headache or clinical dementia.",0,1689
842,"BACKGROUND: Cranieovertebral junction lesions in the paediatric population are associated with a low survival rate, which has declined in recent years. Neurological disability is a major concern due to the high economical cost it represents. Paediatric patients are more susceptible to this lesion because of hyperextension capacity, flat articulation, and increased ligamentous laxity. Survival after these kinds of injuries has been more often reported in adults, but are limited in the paediatric population. CLINICAL CASE: A case is reported of an 8-year-old male with occipitocervical and atlantoaxial dislocation associated with clivus fracture, brain oedema, and post-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). A halo vest system was placed with no traction. One month after the trauma the patient was surgically treated with C1 and C2 trans-articular screws, occipitocervical fixation with plate and screws, and C1- C2 fixation with tricortical bone graft and wires without complication. He has now returned to school and is self-sufficient. CONCLUSIONS: With better pre-hospital medical care and with improved surgical techniques the mortality rate has declined in this kind of lesion.",0,1193
843,"Linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis of childhood is a rare autoimmune disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, although it has been linked to drugs, infections, immunological diseases and lymphoproliferative processes. We report the case of a 6 year old girl who consulted for perioral bullous lesions without other symptoms. Neither treatment with mupirocin nor methylprednisolone therapy achieved remission of cutaneous lesions. Skin biopsy showed a linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis. It was not possible to start treatment with dapsone because of a partial glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, so topical treatment was maintained with good evolution of lesions. Linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis is a rare disease whose differential diagnosis includes other bullous diseases. Pathology is essential for diagnosis. When treatment with dapsone is not possible, topical corticosteroids may be an alternative, either alone or associated with other treatments.",0,967
844,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) syndrome is a rare disease caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene. Patients show a reduced response to hypercapnia and hypoxia accompanied by diffuse disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and occasionaly also disturbances in neuroimaging. A specific neuropsychological profile has not been described in children and adolescents with CCHS. CASE REPORTS: We describe three cases (aged between 4 and 19 years) with different profiles of affectation in cognitive and functionality. These profiles are compared with the features described in the literature about neuropsychology in CCHS. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of functional impairment in the CCHS is variable: in case 1, a severe global developmental delay with autistic features and marked functional involvement is described. In case 2, bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus is associated with involvement in social cognition and in executive functions with moderate functional repercussion. Case 3 shows difficulties in some cognitive executive functions (planning and non-verbal fluency), but without functional repercussion. Neuropsychological assessment can help in the clinical management of these patients by determining and guiding the need for rehabilitation treatments.",0,1299
845,"Garengeot's hernia corresponds to the presence of the appendix within a femoral hernia, associated or not with acute appendicitis. The diagnosis of this uncommon situation is usually done during surgery. Furthermore, the clinical presentation as necrotizing fasciitis is a rare condition. We report a 54 years old obese hypertensive woman with rheumatoid arthritis of 40 years of evolution treated with methotrexate and prednisone. She consulted for pain and erythema in the right inguinal region. Laboratory revealed leukocytosis and an elevated C-reactive Protein. Suspecting a cellulitis, the patient was admitted for antimicrobial therapy. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a perforated acute appendicitis in an inguinal hernia with extensive pelvic cellulitis associated with signs of fasciitis. At surgery, an extensive groin and pubic fasciitis was evident, with a necrotic and perforated appendix within a femoral hernia. Surgical debridement, open appendectomy, and femoral hernioplasty without mesh were carried out. Vacuum-assisted closure was installed in the coverage defect. Three surgical debridement procedures were required for the closure of the wound. Two weeks after the first surgical procedure, the patient was discharged in good condition. During the follow-up, she evolved with a surgical wound dehiscence, which was managed with wound dressings until closure.",0,1393
846,"IgG4 disease is a multi-systemic condition involving pancreas, salivary glands and lymph nodes. Less frequently, it causes interstitial nephritis and involves the lungs. We report a 58 years old male with a four years history of hemoptysis and renal dysfunction characterized by hematuria and proteinuria, responsive to steroidal therapy. The renal biopsy established the diagnosis of IgG4 associated interstitial nephritis. Lung involvement was considered secondary to the same systemic disease.",0,496
847,"BACKGROUND: avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a new eating disorder category among eating disorders. Its recent incorporation explains the lack of studies evaluating the optimal treatment and follow-up of patients with this disorder. CASE REPORT: we present the case of a 20-year-old patient with 3-week dysphagia and 20% weight loss. After ruling out organic disorders, he was diagnosed with ARFID and required parenteral and tube feeding until the improvement of the eating disorder. DISCUSSION: in this patient, severe caloric malnutrition secondary to the eating disorder made it necessary to turn to the parenteral and enteral approach until the behavioral modification and progressive food exposure were effective. The absence of etiological treatment makes cognitive behavioral intervention, along with the correction of nutritional deficiencies, the preferred approach.",0,896
848,"CASE REPORT: A 34 year-old man presented with progressive visual loss in his right eye. Ocular fundus showed a vasoproliferative tumor in the peripheral retina with an associated epiretinal macular membrane. Angiography showed a rapid filling of tumor vessels. The treatment consisted of laser photocoagulation and a single injection of intravitreal ranibizumab. After 8 weeks, there was a residual area of fibrosis, the posterior hyaloid was detached, and the epiretinal membrane disappeared. Visual acuity returned to 20/25. DISCUSSION: Laser photocoagulation and intravitreal ranibizumab combination could be useful for vasoproliferative tumors.",0,648
849,"We report a 73-year-old female patient with Castleman's disease coexistent with large B cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a right axillary lymphadenopathy. An excisional biopsy was performed: microscopically, the lymph node revealed the presence of numerous plasma cells and small lymphoid cells characteristic of Castleman's disease. An analysis of another portion of the specimen revealed lymphoid cells with large abnormal nuclei gathered locally that were CDD 79+, CD 38+ and MUM-1+ as well as positive for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and negative for Epstein Barr virus encoded RNA-1 (EBER).",0,608
850,"OBJECTIVE: We report 2 cases of small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (CCP) of the urinary bladder in patients aged 37 and 80 years. CCP is a malignancy with poor prognosis. We review the literature, under the current WHO classification (2016). METHODS: Paraffin blocks were cut for HE staining and immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of neuroendocrine differentiation. RESULTS: The main diagnosis was based on histopathologic features, which revealed a diffuse growth pattern of small cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. The result of the additional technical immunoreaction was positive for synaptophysin and CD56. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases have been reviewed with the literature to discuss the evolution and differential diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. This is a rare tumor with very aggressive behavior and its diagnosis lies in its morphology, and immunohistochemical profile.",0,932
851,"BACKGROUND: Silent sinus or imploding antrum syndrome is a very rare condition, consisting of a usually asymptomatic spontaneous collapse of the sinus walls and floor of the orbit. It is associated with negative pressures, and when this occurs, it presents with manifestations such as enophthalmos, hypoglobus, and tilt flow orbital floor. As its incidence is very low, it is frequently missed as a diagnosis, and in fact there are currently fewer than 150 cases reported in the literature. CLINICAL CASES: Three patients have been identified in our practice over a period of two years, with different symptoms that influenced the decision of the treatment modality, which were: watch and wait, endoscopic sinus surgery, or endoscopic sinus surgery plus orbitoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being a rare entity, it stills catches the attention of the ENT, OMF surgery and Ophthalmologist. The diagnosis is mainly radiological, due to the late clinical manifestations and symptomatology. The treatment should be individualised and based on the symptoms and the individual decision of each patient, firstly by Functional Endoscopic sinus surgery, and once sinus permeability is restored, it may require augmentation surgery of the orbital floor, either with autologous bone implant, titanium or other material. It is important to be aware of this pathology, to know and to suspect it, avoiding misdiagnosis.",0,1403
852,"INTRODUCTION: The onset of affective and psychotic in liver transplant patients symptoms, raises the need to explore the possible etiologies of mental symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: Four clinical cases of patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, who in the early post transplant showed affective symptoms, delusions and psychomotor agitation for which they needed psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with psychotropic drugs are presented. Three of the patients had clinical improvement and one patient died by suicide. DISCUSSION: The development of mental symptoms in the post-transplant period opens the possibility of considering the secondary organic mental disorder a basic condition. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse drug reaction may explain affective mental disorders in these four cases were reported.",0,857
853,"We report an unusual case of an amelanotic melanoma in a 7 year old hispanic child with subclinical globe perforation. Uveal melanoma rarely occurs in children. Young affected patients are mostly light-colored eye Caucasian adolescents. Since they are not common, these tumors are usually not recognized and misdiagnosed. Differential diagnoses and therapeutic options are outlined.",0,382
854,Fracture and migration of the tracheotomy tube in the tracheobronchial tree is an uncommon complication of tracheotomy. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are essential because of the potential risk of fatal respiratory obstruction. Diagnosis should be suspected in all tracheotomized children undergoing breathing difficulties. It is confirmed by chest x-ray and endoscopic examination. The recommended treatment includes the endoscopic removal of the aspirated cannula through the tracheal stoma. We describe the clinical presentation and the management of a broken tracheotomy tube which was presented as a foreign body in the airway of a 18-month-old child. Recommendations for tracheostomy care are listed.,0,713
855,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sirolimus (SR) is a lipophilic macrocytic lactone with immunosuppressive properties (mTOR inhibitor) commonly used in solid organ transplantation and recently introduced in the prophylaxis and treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Its numerous side effects include: hyperlipidemia, arthralgias, noncardiac peripheral edema, thrombotic microangiopathy and interstitial pneumonitis. SR-associated pneumonitis is a rare but potentially serious complication due to its increasing utilization in transplant patients. PATIENT AND METHOD: We report the case of a patient undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with severe respiratory distress and SR therapy. RESULTS: Microbiological tests were all negative and other complications related to transplantation were discarded. The chest computed tomography of high-resolution showed pneumonitis. The SR therapy was interrupted and treatment was started with steroids with resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: SR associated pneumonitis is a potentially fatal side effect. In patients treated with SR and respiratory failure, we must suspect this complication because early recognition along with drug discontinuation and steroid treatment is essential to reverse this complication.",0,1261
856,"Patients with HIV are susceptible to mycobacterium infection. In the case of fast-growing mycobacteria, the group to which Mycobacterium fortuitum (M. fortuitum) belongs, infections have been described in the skin, lungs, lymph nodes and disseminated disease. We present the case of a 43-year-old male patient with pre-diagnosis of HIV in antiretroviral therapy, which comes as a fever, asthenia, weight loss and chronic diarrhea. Abdominal tomography is performed and hepatosplenomegaly is evidenced with nodular lesions in the spleen. The splenic culture was finally positive for M. Fortuitum, with positive PCR to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The current treatment protocols for this type of infection are based on the susceptibility shown in the cultures performed. With regard to coinfections between M. Fortuitum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in HIV positive patients, there are even less information.",0,908
857,"BACKGROUND: The intrathoracic complications from ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement are very rare. However, they are potentially serious if not treated. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of thoracic migration of a peritoneal catheter after ventriculoperitoneal shunt and we also review the literature references with discussion of the different mechanisms of shunt-tip migration described. No case of previous sternotomy as in our patient has been found published. CONCLUSION: All reports recommend early catheter repositioning into the peritoneal cavity after diagnosing the migration described, to prevent worse complications. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that intrathoracic migration can happen and it is necessary to palpate the catheter continuously during passage through subcutaneous tunnelling to prevent it.",0,831
858,"Although radioiodine (131-I) can be used as treatment of hyperthyroidism for patients in hemodialysis, its use is limited and the experience is mainly related to differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We report a 58 years old female on hemodialysis with recurrent hyperthyroidism after propylthiouracil treatment. She was successfully treated with 131-I and four months after the intervention her euthyroid state was confirmed. We measured 131-I activity in blood, dialysate liquid and other waste products, as well as patient radiation exposure rates. We found that 131-I elimination was prolonged through time with no major dependence on hemodialysis, as opposed to the elimination of 131-I in patients with thyroid carcinoma. This was probably due to high radiotracer uptake in hyper functioning thyroid tissue. Conversely, radiation content in dialysate wastes or equipment was minimal. Furthermore, the rate of both environmental exposure and exposure of nursing staff in charge of hemodialysis sessions, was minimal and met international security standards. In conclusion, I-131 therapy showed both appropriate effectiveness and safety in this case and may be considered as a suitable treatment alternative to thyroidectomy when antithyroid drugs are unsuccessful.",0,1265
859,"Coinfection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with tuberculosis (TB) has not been previously reported. Here, we present 2 cases with both MERS-CoV and pulmonary TB. The first case was a 13-year-old patient who was admitted with a 2-month history of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and cough. The second patient was a 30-year-old female who had a 4-week history of cough associated with shortness of breath and weight loss of 2 kg. The 2 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary TB and had positive MERS-CoV. Both patients were discharged to complete their therapy for TB at home. It is likely that both patients had pulmonary TB initially as they had prolonged symptoms and they subsequently developed MERS-CoV infection. It is important to carefully evaluate suspected MERS-CoV patients for the presence of other infectious diseases, such as TB, especially if cohorting is done for suspected MERS-CoV to avoid nosocomial transmission.",1,960
860,"Trichosporon asahii is a ubiquitous fungus that has been isolated as part of human microbiota. There has been an emergence of this pathogen in recent years, causing superficial and deep seated infections. There are scarce reports of urinary tract infections in pediatric intensive care burn units caused by this agent. We describe the cases of 2 pediatric patients with prolonged hospitalization due to severe burns that had received several antibiotic courses for previous infections. Both presented sepsis secondary to catheter related urinary tract infection by Trichosporon asahii. Both patients underwent urinary catheter replacement and were treated effectively with voriconazole for 10 days. In the cases presented, sepsis was assumed to be due to Trichosporon asahii since no other microorganism was identified and the patients showed favorable outcome with the prescribed treatment with voriconazole and replacement of the urinary catheter.",0,949
861,"Maxillary cysts are a diverse group of entities that include benign and malignant odontogenic tumors. Information on the prevalence of this disease is limited. It is more common among males, and usually occurs in the second and third decade of life. The proportion of 6 to 7 year old patients with dentigerous cysts is only 9.1%. Dentigerous cysts encompass the crown of a permanent and unerupted impacted teeth. They are usually slow growing asymptomatic lesions that are not discovered until they affect surrounding organs. The aim of this study is to present an unusual case of dentigerous cyst and to inform the pediatrician about the management of a unilateral maxillary tumor in a healthy child, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary approach of this disease.",0,777
862,"LEOPARD syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by germline mutations in the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. LEOPARD is an acronym for the main manifestations of the syndrome, namely, multiple Lentigines, Electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of genitalia, Retardation of growth, and sensorineural Deafness. None of these characteristic features, however, are pathognomonic of LEOPARD syndrome, and since they are highly variable, they are often not present at the time of diagnosis. We describe 2 cases of LEOPARD syndrome without hearing loss or pulmonary stenosis in which diagnosis was confirmed by identification of a mutation in the PTPN11 gene. Regular monitoring is important for the early detection of complications, as these can occur at any time during the course of disease.",0,881
863,"We report a 41-year-old man with HIV and a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treated for seven months with Fluticasone/Salmeterol and antiretroviral therapy (Lamivudine, Tenofovir, Atazanavir and Ritonavir). While using these medications, the patients developed a Cushing syndrome in a period of five months. After performing laboratory and imaging tests, it was concluded that the most probable cause of the syndrome was the interaction of inhaled steroids with Ritonavir. After discontinuing these medications the syndrome reverted in a period of 8 months.",0,563
864,"The association of cerebral ischemic attack with patent foramen ovale has not been extensively studied, and frequently the site of origin of embolism is not detected despite routine studies. We present the case of a young patient with ischemic stroke and permeable oval foramen in the context of May Thurner syndrome. The May Thurner syndrome is an entity scarcely studied in the medical literature and it has also been infrequently related to ischemic vascular cerebral accident, but in patients with permeable oval foramen without evidence of the emboligen source, it is interesting to rule it out as a cause of paradoxical embolism.",0,635
865,"CASE REPORT: We report a case of 70-year-old male from Sicily, who presented with a bilateral eyelid mass involving the tarsal conjunctiva, found to be Kaposi's sarcoma on histologic examination. Cutaneous and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma involvement was documented. The patient had no prior diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection. This case was managed successfully after the completion of five cycles of chemotherapy with liposomal doxorubicin, and his eyelid, skin and pulmonary lesions disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Location in the eyelid is a possible, though rare, initial solitary manifestation of Kaposi's sarcoma in elderly HIV-negative patients. Liposomal doxorubicin is a safe and effective treatment.",0,719
867,"INTRODUCTION: Development of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) in the context of typhoid fever (TF) is a very rare but serious complication. METHODS: Description of the first pediatric case of typhoid fever acquired in a non-endemic area complicated by sHLH. A systematic literature review of sHLH in the context of TF was performed with extraction of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: The literature search revealed 17 articles (22 patients). Fifteen patients were eligible for data analysis (53.4% children). All patients had fever and pancytopenia. Transaminases and LDH were frequently elevated (46.6%). Salmonella typhi was detected mainly by blood culture (64.3%). All the patients received antibiotics whereas immunomodulation (dexamethasone) was used in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high suspicion index for this condition is needed even in non-endemic areas. The addition of immunmodulation to standard antimicrobial therapy should be considered in selected cases.",0,1011
869,"Acute cervical pathology may lead to serious airway compromise resulting from anatomical distortion secondary to obstruction or deviation of the upper airway, scenarios where any airway device can be fallible. Passage of a fiberoptic bronchoscopy to expose the glottis may be very difficult and tracheostomy may be impractical or risky in advanced cases. We present the use of the TotalTrack VLM to secure the airway for emergent surgery in 2 uncooperative patients with difficult airway due to Ludwig's angina and neck hematoma, respectively, both accompanied by trismus.",0,572
870,"A 60-year-old male with familial combined hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Since childhood, intolerance to intense exercise. The patient was diagnosed of McArdle's disease after an episode of rhabdomyolysis associated with statins as treatment after a myocardial infarction. Since then, he had been treated with diet, fibrates and ezetimibe with good tolerance, despite this, LDL cholesterol (cLDL) remained >180mg/dl. He started to be treated with alirocumab 150mg/sc every 14 days, with excellent clinical response and a decrease in cLDL to 15mg/dl. Our case shows that PCSK9 inhibitors are effective and safe in patients with muscle diseases who have statin contraindication, and they are a good therapeutic tool for these patients.",0,762
871,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 12 year-old boy with congenital glaucoma and low visual acuity diagnosed with Charles Bonnet syndrome. This consisted of the acute onset of complex, repetitive, persistent, and with visual hallucinations (people, brooms and coffeemakers) of self-limited evolution without treatment. The patient was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma at 3 years of age, and subjected to a trabeculectomy in right eye, and trabeculectomy and keratoplasty in his left eye. DISCUSSION: Charles Bonnet syndrome symptoms have been described in adults, but their presence in children is poorly reflected in literature, with unknown characteristics and prevalence.",0,680
872,"Histoplasmosis and leishmaniasis are neglected and endemic diseases in Argentina, and generally are found associated with immunosuppression. We report the case of an immunocompetent 16-years-old man with simultaneous occurrence of central nervous system histoplasmosis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Upon admission, the patient showed a one-month old skin lesion in a leg and mild paraparesis. Imaging studies detected thickening and edema in the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis was within normal range. The case was diagnosed as a demyelinating disorder and treated with high-dose short-term steroids. Seventy-two hours later the patient showed severe paraparesis and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging revealed nodular lesions in the spinal cord. Histoplasma capsulatum belonging to the phylogenetic species LamB was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid samples. The patient received intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B for 30 days, followed by oral fluconazole and itraconazole for one year. Three months after initiation of antifungal treatment, the cutaneous lesion recrudesced and Leishmania amastigotes were observed on microscopic examination. The cutaneous leishmaniasis was treated with intramuscular meglumine antimoniate. The patient's outcome was favorable after treatment for both diseases.",0,1331
873,Central diabetes insipidus is a rare disease in children caused by a deficiency of vasopressin. Its main clinical manifestations are polyuria and polydipsia. Brain malformations are one of the main causes. Desmopressin is the synthetic drug of choice for the treatment. One of the routes of administration is sublingual and its use in infants is very limited. We describe two infants with central diabetes insipidus and hydranencephaly who were successfully treated with sublingual desmopressin.,0,495
874,"Surgical resection of tracheal tumours, especially distal tracheal tumours, is a challenge for the anaesthesiologists involved, mainly due to difficulties in ensuring adequate control of the airway and ventilation.

875,"The medium arcuate ligament syndrome is a rare disorder that results from luminal narrowing of the celiac artery by the insertion of diaphragmatic muscle or the celiac nerve plexus. The syndrome is characterized by weight loss, postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and an epigastric murmur. Surgical management involves the complete division of the medial arcuate ligament. We present two cases satisfactorily treated by laparoscopic surgery. The role of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of this syndrome is a safe alternative approach to open surgery.",0,572
876,"OBJECTIVE: We describe the characterization of a new isolated in Spain of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 producing KPC-3, carbapenems non-susceptible, recovered from a sample of urine from a patient with urinary tract infection and no history of carbapenems exposure. METHODS: After the isolation, identification of K. pneumoniae was performed by biochemical tests and mass spectrometry. The carbapenems susceptibility testing was performed by microdilution and E-test in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton. The study was completed by Rapidec(R) Carba NP. In order to determine the genetic basis of resistance to carbapenems we used Xpert(R) Carba-R for carbapenemase type and subtype was subsequently analyzed by amplification by PCR and sequencing. RESULT: We demonstrated by MLST that the strain belonged to the clone of high-risk ST258. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first characterization, in our media, of a clinical isolated of K. pneumoniae ST258 producing KPC-3 and no history of carbapenems exposure.",0,998
877,"Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis is a rare entity with frequent spontaneous resolution. It usually presents in children with average age of 4.5 years. Its incidence is about 0.5-2.3 cases/million individuals/year. It is, after dermatitis herpetiformis, the most frequent paediatric blister disorder. It usually appears in bouts with acute development of vesicles in strings of pearls; affecting the perioral area and genitalia. Diagnosis is based on the clinical signs and symptoms and biopsy of the skin with subepidermal blister and a linear band of immunoglobulin A in the direct immunofluorescence. Often, diagnosis is made late because of the unawareness of this disease.",0,686
878,Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an effective treatment to treat open-angle glaucoma with a low risk of complications. The case is presented of a 73 year-old woman with uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma who underwent selective laser trabeculoplasty in both eyes and developed bilateral choroidal effusion.,0,320
879,"BACKGROUND: Testicular germ-cell carcinoma is the most frequent neoplasm in males aged 15 to 35 years old. It is bilateral in 2% to 3%, and synchronous in 20% to 25% of the cases. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 19 year-old male, with abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed abdominal mass in the umbilical region, and the computed tomography scan showed a retroperitoneal tumour, with alpha-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and human chorionic gonadotropin above limits. Testicular ultrasound showed bilateral lesions. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, identifying an unresectable retroperitoneal tumour. Biopsies were taken, reporting mixed germ cell tumour composed of choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma. Six cycles of chemotherapy were given, based on bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin, with partial tumour response. Later on, the patient underwent bilateral radical orchiectomy, with pathology reporting a synchronous bilateral testicular teratoma. A second line of chemotherapy was given, based on vincristine, etoposide, ifosfamide and cisplatinum. Nevertheless, the disease progressed, with metastatic dissemination and the patient died. DISCUSSION: Germ cells tumours can present in primary extra-gonadal locations. It is difficult to distinguish a retroperitoneum primary germ cell tumour from metastatic disease of a clinically undetected gonadal tumour or one that has regressed, like the situation described in the case presented. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety percent of patients diagnosed with germ cell tumours can be cured. However, delay in diagnosis correlates with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis.",0,1650
880,"BACKGROUND: A gallstone colonic ileus is a very rare condition. CLINICAL CASE: The case is reported of an 87 year-old patient who came to the Emergency Department due to an intestinal obstruction of several days onset, which was caused by a gallstone affected sigmoid colon. CONCLUSION: Colonic gallstone ileus is a rare disease that usually occurs in older patients due to the passage of large gallstone directly from the gallbladder to colon, through a cholecystocolonic fistula. It has a high morbidity and mortality.",0,520
881,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-kappaB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3-TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal region. Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. Collectively, our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response.",1,1636
882,"Although infrequent, Trypanosoma cruzi reactivation is possible among patients with HIV/AIDS infection that develop a tumor-like or granulomatous lesion in the CNS. We report the case of a 60 years old male patient with HIV/AIDS and low CD4 lymphocytes count with cerebellar symptoms and mild paresis, associated to supra and infratentorial hypodense lesions and positive serology tests both to T. gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi. Empirical therapy against toxoplasmosis was prescribed together with antiretroviral therapy but without a favorable response. Brain Chagas disease was confirmed by quantitative PCR in the CSF but he died despite nifurtimox treatment. Despite its rare occurrence, Chagas disease affecting the CNS is possible among patients with HIV/AIDS infection. Epidemiological exposure, a positive Chagas serological test and the image pattern of brain lesions support the suspicion. Diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular test in CSF samples, including new quantitative methods. Despite an adverse prognosis, specific therapy can be attempted besides antiretroviral treatment.",0,1093
883,"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an infrequent disorder. It can be idiopathic or secondary to infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic disease. The recently described <IgG4-related disease> could be the origin of many cases considered cryptogenic. We present the case of a 60-year-old man, with a history of headache and episcleritis in both eyes, with partial response to corticoid therapy. The brain MR study with gadolinium showed enhancement and thickening of the dura mater, extending from lateral wall of left temporal and occipital lobes to ipsilateral tentorium. Meningeal biopsy showed fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with more than 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high power field. After treatment with rituximab there was clinical improvement accompanied by the virtual disappearance of the alterations detected in neuroimaging. Hypertrophic pachymeningitis as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease can be based on MRI findings if plasma IgG4 are elevated.",0,969
884,"BACKGROUND: Intussusception is defined as a segment of the gastrointestinal tract and mesentery within the lumen of an adjacent segment. It is a rare condition in adults that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the rectum. Only 5% of all intussusceptions are presented in adults, and in 1-5% of all cases of intestinal obstruction. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is rare, and is usually found in the lung, and rarely detected in some intestinal portions. It causes a variety of non-specific symptoms, with those that present as an intussusception being uncommon. CLINICAL CASE: A female of 69 years with partial bowel obstruction secondary to intestinal intussusception due to an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, a rarely diagnosed condition and never published before. DISCUSSION: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours are rare, and in this case with an atypical presentation that was surgically resolved satisfactorily. These entities are difficult to diagnose, with histopathology giving the definitive diagnosis. A literature review was performed to gather recent information about their diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours require a high level of suspicion, as diagnosis prior to surgery is difficult. Surgery is considered the treatment of choice, requiring leaving free surgical edges to prevent recurrences.",0,1395
885,"BACKGROUND: Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is an unusual, self-limited, inflammatory disease that affects the choriocapillaris, and external retinal layers. CLINICAL CASE: A 26 year-old male patient complained of decreased visual acuity, as well as photopsia in both eyes for the past three days. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. There was no anterior chamber inflammation or vitritis in either eye. There were plaque-like, cream-coloured sub-retinal lesions with ill-defined borders in the posterior pole of both eyes. Fluorescein angiography showed hypofluorescent lesions in early phases that corresponded to the lesions seen in the clinical examination. These lesions were hyperfluorescent in later phases of the angiography. Based on the clinical and angiographic findings, an acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy diagnosis was made. CONCLUSIONS: Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is an inflammatory condition of unknown origin that is part of the differential diagnosis of placoid retinal diseases.",0,1127
886,"INTRODUCTION: Colloid cysts are benign tumors of the third ventricle. Most of them remain asymptomatic. However, some patients can develop since intermittent headaches to an acute deterioration and even sudden death. Several theories exist for which there would be a sudden death in these patients, among which include the rapid increase in size of the cyst, its rupture, the disturbance of hypothalamus-mediated cardiovascular reflex control and the unusual bleeding of the cyst, with only 15 cases described in the literature. CASE REPORT: A 45 year old male with hypertension with acute hydrocephalus due to a hemorrhagic colloid cyst in the third ventricle. An external ventricular drain on each side was introduced and he was admitted to the ICU, where brain death was certified. After removal of the cyst through transcortical frontal approach, the diagnosis of colloid cyst with remains of hemolyzed blood was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Bleeding in colloid cysts is exceptional, and can occur in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, making it difficult to recognize this complication.",0,1094
887,"Infections remain an issue of particular relevance in renal transplant patients, particularly viral infections. Human parvovirus B19 infection causes severe refractory anaemia, pancytopenia and thrombotic microangiopathy. Its presence is recognized by analysing blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by the discovery of typical giant proerythroblasts in the bone marrow. We report the case of a 65 year-old man with a history of deceased donor renal transplant in September 2014. At 38 days after the transplant, the patient presented progressive anaemia that was resistant to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. At 64 days after transplant, hyperthermia occurred with progressive deterioration of the patient's general condition. The viral serology and the first blood PCR for human parvovirus B19 were both negative. At 4 months and 19 days after, a bone marrow biopsy was conducted, showing giant erythroblasts with nuclear viral inclusions that were compatible with parvovirus; a PCR in the tissue confirmed the diagnosis. A second blood PCR was positive for parvovirus. After treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and the temporary discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil, a complete remission of the disease occurred, although the blood PCR for parvovirus B19 remained positive, so monitoring is necessary for future likely recurrence.",0,1349
888,"Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, also known as Gougerot-Carteaud Syndrome, is a rare chronic disease typically affecting young adults. Of unknown etiology, the condition is characterised by oval grayish-brown or erythematous papules that coalesce to form a reticular pattern, usually on the trunk, especially in the intermammary or interscapular region and on the neck. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the appearance of the lesions, the areas affected, and the response to treatment with minocycline. We report 20 cases of patients with histologically confirmed confluent and reticulated papillomatosis who presented linear pseudo-striae, a little known diagnostic sign.",0,689
889,"CASE REPORT: Two sisters of 54 and 60years old, with a history of diabetes and deafness, consulted for decreased visual acuity (VA). Funduscopic examination revealed patchy areas of chorioretinal atrophy with annular arrangement around the fovea. Genetic study identified the heteroplasmic mutation 3243A>G in mitochondrial DNA, which supports syndrome maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) or Ballinger-Wallace disease. DISCUSSION: The finding of such macular disorders, especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and deafness, should suggest the performing of a mitochondrial genome screening to identify this unusual syndrome.",0,646
890,"Raynaud's Phenomenon is caused by spasm of the small arteries and arterioles of the fingers. It is triggered by various stimuli including exposure to cold or a stressful event. It may be symmetrical or wrap one end. The appearance of this entity in children is rare. We report the case of a 4 year old male consultation health center by episodes of coldness, pallor and pain in both feet.",0,388
891,"Granulomatous dermatitis has been associated with hematologic disorders, including the myelodysplastic syndromes. We describe the first case of granulomatous dermatitis associated with polycythemia vera, presenting as large erythematous nodules mimicking panniculitis. We also present the seventh case associated with myelodysplasia, with erythematous plaques on the face and neck, similar to a neutrophilic dermatosis. We consider it particularly interesting for dermatologists to be aware of this dermatosis as a nonspecific manifestation of various hematologic disorders. We suggest performing additional tests (complete blood count) to exclude the possibility that the skin manifestations are the initial sign of hematologic disease. Furthermore, we propose using the broader term, granulomatous dermatitis, to refer to these disorders as, although there are more reports of interstitial forms, cases with a more nodular presentation have also been published, and the importance of the diagnosis derives not from the subtype but from the relationship with an underlying disease.",0,1082
892,"The case concerns a 73 year-old female with a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism of 8 months onset. Since then, she has suffered hyperaemia and ocular proptosis. Bilateral exophthalmos was observed in the physical examination, along with mild conjunctival hyperaemia in the right eye associated with dilated episcleral vessels. Computed tomography showed enlarged inferior rectus with no signs of ocular nerve or ophthalmic superior vein compression. In the orbital Doppler ultrasound scan, there was an arterialised flow over the superior ophthalmic vein, giving a possible diagnosis of cavernous carotid. Thyroid orbitopathy with a cavernous carotid fistula is an unusual combination in which the clinical signs of both pathologies can mask the complete diagnosis; thus it is important to be acquainted with both pathologies for their correct management and multidisciplinary treatment.",0,882
893,"A 55 year-old female patient with unilateral Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN) developed macular oedema (MO) after the resolution of her necrosis. The macular oedema (MO) was managed and controlled for four years with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Anti-VEGF therapy could be useful for the treatment of MO secondary to ARN, the same as for treating MO resulting from panuveitis, where its efficacy has been already demonstrated.",0,428
894,"Prostate cancer is an extremely rare cause of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. These tend to be aggressive tumors and SIADH can carry serious clinical consequences. A 64 years old patient was diagnosed with Gleason 4+3: 7 prostate adenocarcinoma in December 2014 and received hormonal blockade therapy. By March 2015 he was admitted for symptomatic hyponatremia and SIADH secretion was diagnosed, with no other probable cause than prostate cancer. He suffered a rapid progression of his oncologic disease, surprisingly with PSA in normal range, and died in the short term. There is great clinical and histopathological variability in the cases reported in the literature of association of prostate carcinoma and SIADH. However, they all agree on the aggressiveness of these tumors. This characteristic is present in tumors that have neuroendocrine features. They are frequently resistant to hormonal treatment and may present with paraneoplastic syndromes such as SIADH. The profile of its molecular alterations is under study for the development of target therapies. The association of prostate adenocarcinoma and SIADH is very uncommon and could involve neuroendocrine differentiation. For this reason, it is essential to perform a new biopsy of the tumor or its metastases at the progressive disease in order to conduct an appropriate treatment according to its morphological, immunohistochemical and, in the future, molecular characteristics.",0,1479
895,"An assortment of clinical and laboratory abnormalities may occur as paraneoplastic syndromes in lymphomas. Rheumatological and dermatological manifestations such as paraneoplastic arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum must be underscored. We report a 28 years old woman who developed pyoderma gangrenosum and two years later presented with arthritis of knees and ankles associated with panniculitis interpreted as erythema induratum that was pathologically confirmed. She developed a reactivation of pyoderma gangrenosum, that was refractory to treatment. Complementary studies showed a pulmonary nodule and a right paravertebral mass with involvement of the psoas muscle. Biopsies of both masses and a new pathological skin study demonstrated a large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",0,779
896,"(99m)Tc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography ((99m)Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT) has an important role in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Despite being its main indication, this study does not only evaluate myocardial perfusion, but much more. Moreover, during the SPECT acquisition, the field area covered includes many important organs of the thorax and abdomen, so extracardiac abnormalities can be observed. The correct etiologic diagnosis of them is only possible if we understand how (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin works and make a comprehensive investigation of the clinical history of the patient.",0,615
897,"Within the assistance and support to coping with perinatal death, it must be considered that there is a group of women whose process has some features that give specific connotations. We talked about when the perinatal loss occurs due to a maternal decision to the presence of a fetal malformation. These cases today, thanks to advances in the techniques of control fetal development, are not uncommon. In their assistance, healthcare professionals should be aware that they often present a great sense of guilt and ambivalence between well-made decision and the hardness of having to come to it. A case of a pregnant woman undergoing a fetal fetolisis and care plan developed in her assistance for the induction of labor, delivery and immediate postpartum period is presented. This plan includes the problems of collaboration and the independent problems that are formulated according to the NANDA, NOC and NIC taxonomies. The implication for practice after studying this case leads to the duty to equally address the coping with a stillbirth, whether it was spontaneous or had it been determined by fetal malformation completion, giving parents the ability to view and contact with their child.",0,1196
898,"The case presented is a 25-year-old male with a malignant neuroectodermal tumour on the left chest wall (Askin tumour), treated with surgery after neoadyuvant chemotherapy and followed by consolidation chemotherapy. After 9 years of disease free survival, the patient developed an acute pulmonary embolism. The echocardiogram, thoracic CT, and cardiac MRI scans revealed a mass in the right atrium. Recurrence of an Askin tumour versus an atrium myxoma was suspected. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed an intense hypermetabolic right atrium mass with extension to the right ventricle highly suggestive of malignancy. The result of the histopathology examination after biopsy and subsequently exeresis of the right atrium mass was consistent with a metastasis of the primary tumour.",0,771
900,"Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a synthetic stimulant drug of the cathinone class. Similar effects to those of cocaine and ecstasy are reported by users, with a high addictive potential. Given its increasing rate of consumption in Europe, it is getting more and more attention from the addiction field. In spite of that, little is known about the long-term consequences of prolonged heavy use. The two following cases might depict some of them. Case 1 was a middle-age man who reported three years of intravenous use of mephedrone. He used to binge for several days in a row. Psychotic symptoms appeared after a few months, especially paranoid delusions. Sent to aftercare in a therapeutic community, delusions kept reappearing after prolonged abstinence. A good response to risperidone was observed. Case 2 was a young man who used mephedrone heavily for two years, always snorted. Upon admission to the therapeutic community, the patient reported auditory hallucinations that partially remitted with olanzapine. Both cases showed a good insight and no personality deterioration. Given its similarities to other substances that are known to induce psychotic symptoms, and the increasing consumption of mephedrone around Europe, similar cases are expected in the near future. Conventional antipsychotic treatment seems a reasonable pharmacological approach.",0,1363
901,"Spinal angiolipomas are fairly infrequent benign tumours that are usually located in the epidural space of the thoracic column and represent 0.14% to 1.3% of all spinal tumours. Lumbar angiolipomas are extremely rare, representing only 9.6% of all spinal extradural angiolipomas. We report the case of a woman who complained of a lumbar pain of several months duration with no neurological focality and that had intensified in the last three days without her having had any injury or made a physical effort. The MR revealed an extradural mass L1-L2, on the posterior face of the medulla, decreasing the anteroposterior diameter of the canal. The patient symptoms improved after surgery. Total extirpation of the lesion is possible in most cases, and the prognosis is excellent even if the lesion is infiltrative. For this reason, excessively aggressive surgery is not necessary to obtain complete resection.",0,907
902,"The increased use of surgery as a treatment or as an alternative for improvement means that we have a larger number of patients in the operating theatre, including those who suffer from rare diseases. Poland Syndrome is a rare congenital disease associated with muscle development. These patients may have a broad spectrum of abnormalities, which include thoracic anomalies, which can alter the ventilatory management at the level of the airway; the possible onset of malignant hyperthermia. This leads the anaesthetist to take certain preventive measures. We report the case of a patient with Poland syndrome operated for the placement of a breast prosthesis. We avoid halogenated agents, and use a Total Intravenous Anaesthesia with propofol. The appearance of muscle spasms as a result of the use of propofol, forced us into a second anaesthesia to perform total intravenous anaesthesia with Midazolam.",0,905
903,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case of poliorchidism because despite being known, its incidence is very low. METHOD: A review of the medical records of a patient with the diagnosis of polyorchidism identified during a surgical intervention for inguinoscrotal hernia. RESULTS: A 32-year-old male patient with past medical history referred with inguinal pain. An increase in volume was identified in the right inguinoscrotal region that protruded with Valsalva maneuver and another lump in the right scrotal region. During the operation, a right supernumerary testis was identified in the intrascrotal region with an independent epididymis and sharing a common vas deferens. Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed and the third testis was placed in the scrotal sac. Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the normality during the operation and the absence of anomalies in the supernumerary testis by Doppler ultrasound, conservative treatment was decided.",0,972
904,"Although infrequent, bowel interposition between diaphragm and liver, Chilaiditis sign or syndrome (without or with gastrointestinal symptoms), are a major clinical condition given the possibilities of differential diagnosis, such as pneumoperitoneum, diaphragmatic hernia and subphrenic abscess. OBJECTIVE: To report the cases of two preschool patients with Chilaiditi s sign and syndrome, as well as to highlight the importance of this clinical condition. CLINICAL CASES: Case 1: A male preschooler evaluated by respiratory disease without abdominal symptoms. Thorax X-ray shows left retrocardiac infiltrates and air in right subdiaphragmatic region. Previous radiographies shows the same image. He was diagnosed with Chilaiditi sign associated with pneumonia, antibiotics were used before discharge. Case 2: A female preschooler, evaluated by abdominal distention and constipation. A previous thorax X-ray shows bowel interposition between diaphragm and liver. Barium enema confirmed the findings. Blood test were normal. A Chilaiditi's syndrome was diagnosed. She received medical treatment with favorable evolution. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight the importance of this clinical condition that, despite being infrequent, constitutes a diagnostic challenge in the emergency services.",0,1290
905,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented on a girl with a unilateral retinoblastoma that required treatment with intra-arterial chemotherapy. In the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed 1 month after intra-arterial chemotherapy treatment, post-laminar optic nerve (ON) enhancement was observed, leading to the suspicion of an ON tumour infiltration. Additional examinations were requested by which a probable optic neuropathy was diagnosed. DISCUSSION: The ON enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in retinoblastoma generally corresponds to tumour invasion of the ON. However, other diagnostic alternatives associated with the use of new treatments, such as intra-arterial chemotherapy, should be considered.",0,740
906,"We reported a case of non-invasive pulmonary infection by Scedosporium apiospermum in 67 years old female with bronchiectasis and caverns secondary to tuberculosis. Diagnosis was made with lung CT and bronchial lavage cultures. The patient was initially treated with itraconazole for six weeks without success and then voriconazole for 16 weeks, with good clinical response.",0,374
907,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with multisutural or single craniosynostosis, often suffer from Chiari malformation and syringomyelia. The surgical management of syringomyelia in these patients is controversial. CASE REPORT: A 3-year-old girl was referred with complex craniosynostosis that had not been corrected surgically. She was asymptomatic despite the cranial MRI showed a Chiari malformation and one year later she developed a cervico-dorso-lumbar syringomyelia. She underwent a decompressive suboccipital craniectomy but subsequently suffered a worsening of syringomyelia. The intracranial pressure monitoring was pathological so it was decided to perform a decompressive bilateral fronto-parieto-temporal craniotomy and remodeling of the cranial vault, achieving a significant reduction of syringomyelia. CONCLUSIONS: After reviewing the literature, it is noted that there is currently no consensus on the treatment of syringomyelia in patients with craniosynostosis and Chiari malformation. Some authors recommend the simultaneous surgical suboccipital and cranial vault decompression, others only decompression of the cranial vault and other enlargement of the posterior fossa with distractors. In cases where the suboccipital decompression was performed first, the syringomyelia was not improved or stabilized. We conclude that the most effective treatment for patients with syringomyelia and craniosynostosis is decompressive remodeling of the cranial vault, as the main cause of syringomyelia is the raised intracranial pressure and lack of skull compliance.",0,1564
908,"BACKGROUND: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, or Ogilvie syndrome, is a motility abnormality characterised by rapid and progressive dilation of the large intestine. To achieve a diagnosis it is fundamental to exclude mechanical obstruction with imaging studies such as computer axial tomography. The combined incidence of Ogilvie and dysmorphic syndrome has not been described. CLINICAL CASE: Female patient of 28 years old with a history of infant cerebral palsy came to emergency room with 4 days of intestinal obstruction. She had hypokalaemia that was reverted, but persisted with obstruction. Later after 72h with recovery of fluids and electrolytes and administration of prokinetics, the obstruction reversed. She was discharged with no complications. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive medical treatment solves most cases. Promising results have been achieved with neostigmine. In the event of no response to drug therapy, the next step is endoscopic treatment. Even with high recurrence this is preferred due to its lower level of complications in contrast to surgical decompression. Neonatal dysmorphic syndrome is often associated with disorders of the central nervous system. So far, there have been no reports on the incidence of this disease with Ogilvie syndrome, although 9% of cases have been described as associated with neurological events. Conservative management in this disease is the initial approach. Interventions should be reserved for when conservative treatment fails.",0,1486
909,"BACKGROUND: Emerging fungi infections, although being not the most frequent, are a cause of major morbidity and mortality in recipients of solid organ transplants. The infections caused by the fungi Scedosporium apiospermum are a paradigmatic example of these. CASE REPORT: We present the clinical case of a 55 year-old female kidney transplant recipient that got infected with S. apiospermum through the skin. Intensive antifungal therapy was started, especially considering that the patient had an arteriovenous fistula at the site of infection. The fungus could have kept in the fistula, and a subsequent reinfection took place. The patient required both medical and surgical treatment (removal of the prosthetic material), that led to a complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: S. apiospermum infections carry a high risk of complications, and are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed/transplant patients. Therefore, the adequate knowledge of this type of mycosis, as well as the making of an adequate differential diagnosis, become fundamental for the prevention of the complications arising from them.",0,1125
910,"Antagonists of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (ATNF) are used for the treatment of multiple diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, usually, when they are refractory to first-line treatment(1). The use of ATNF has been associated with the induction of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease, vasculitis, sarcoidosis-like diseases and, recently, acute granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis. We report a case of acute nongranulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis in an HLA-B27-positive patient with axial spondyloarthritis and Crohn's disease being treated with adalimumab.",0,678
911,"Pulmonary sequestration is acystic or solid congenital lung malformation comprised of non functional lung tissue that does not communicate with the normal tracheobronchial tree and has a systemic arterial blood supply. There are two forms of sequestration: intralobar and extralobar. Its treatment is surgical resection. Here we presented a case of premature neonate with extralobar pulmonary sequestration who had respiratory failure and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. Following surgery, the patient showed significant clinical improvement.",0,542
912,Lingual tonsil hypertrophy can cause varying degrees of airway obstruction and is considered a risk factor for difficult mask ventilation and tracheal intubation. We report a case of unexpected difficult airway in a patient with unknown lingual tonsil hypertrophy that was solved with the use of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.,0,330
913,"Fractures are an important entity to consider in pediatric patients. There are certain diseases in which bones fracture with a minimal trauma. Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive unusual type of craneo metaphyseal dysplasia, that presents frequently as fracture in a pathological bone. A 9 year old caucasian female, diagnosed with pycnodysostosis, was admitted with a right femur fracture as a result of a low energy trauma. Radiographic studies showed bilateral femur fractures, proximal fracture and non-union in antecurvatum of the left tibia. Pycnodysostosis is a rare disease, generally diagnosed at an early age by growth restriction, frequent fractures or fractures with low energy trauma. Therapy alternatives are limited, and no permanent cure has been developed. If a patient has dysmorphic facial features and fractures in a pathological bone, it is important to suspect bone dysplasia, such as pycnodysostosis and its differential diagnoses.",0,960
914,"Carpal coalitions are relatively frequent between bones in the same carpal row. Coalitions between bones of different rows, however, are very uncommon. We present a case of bilateral intercarpal coalition between the trapezium and scaphoid as an incidental finding, confirming its hereditary origin since a parent has the same bilateral coalition.",0,347
915,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) remains as an important cause of morbidity in the world and in our country, while in Chile the incidence has decreased after the incorporation of the 10 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in the routine infant inmunization schedule (EPI). One of the expected effects of the program after vaccination with 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine is the likely replacement serotype phenomenon that means the presence of ENI caused by serotypes not included in the vaccine. In this context, we present the case of a child with pneumococcal meningitis caused by serotype 19 A of fatal course. The occurrence of ENI in a later stage of pneumococcal vaccine incorporation in Chile reinforces the importance of active surveillance, in order to know in detail the impact of vaccination, distribution of circulating serotypes and their correlation with the different clinical disease and their severity.",0,925
916,"A 19-year-old male came to the Emergency Room of our hospital due to an episode of dystonic movements and disorientation 4 days after consuming methamphetamine, which evolved to a catatonic frank syndrome and eventually to status epilepticus. Definitive diagnosis was anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the limbic area of autoimmune origin in which early diagnosis and treatment are key elements for the final outcome. In this case, initial normal tests and previous methamphetamine poisoning delayed diagnosis, because inhaled-methamphetamine poisoning causes similar clinical symptoms to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Methamphetamine poisoning may have caused an immune response in the patient, bringing on the progress of the pathology.",0,765
917,"UNLABELLED: Objetive: To describe etanercept use and effectiveness on steroid- refractary acute graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation. METHOD: Patients treated with etanercept as off label use for steroid-refractary acute graft-versus-host disease were selected and each patient's medical history was reviewed to assess the clinical response. RESULTS: The study included five patients: four presented with digestive manifestations and one presented pulmonary and liver manifestations. 80% of patients showed a clinical response: 60% a partial response and 20% a total response. In four cases etanercept 25mg was administered twice a week with variable duration of treatment, achieving no response in 1 case (3 weeks), partial response in two 2 cases (4 weeks and 8 weeks) and a complete response in 1 case (8 week period). Only one case was treated with etanercept 50mg administered twice a week for 5 weeks with a partial treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response rate is consistent with the previously published data. This updates the scarce bibliographic information about etanecept use in steroid-refractary acute graft-versus-host disease. Due to clinical design limitations and the small patient population, future clinical studies should be conducted to assess the efficacy and security of etanercept in these patients.",0,1368
918,"Primary progressive aphasia is a clinical syndrome caused by a neurodegeneration of areas and neural networks involved in language, usually in the left hemisphere. The term ""crossed aphasia"" denotes an acquired language dysfunction caused by a lesion in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant hand. A case is presented on a 75-year-old right-handed woman with a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia with word-finding difficulties of 2 years onset. The (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed right temporoparietal hypometabolism. A functional MRI scan was performed during a verb naming task in order to characterise language lateralisation patterns. A similar activation pattern was observed in both hemispheres, with less activation than expected in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. These findings support that logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia should not be considered as a neurodegeneration starting in the left brain hemisphere, but as a syndrome characterised by asymmetric neurodegeneration of brain regions and neural networks involved in language.",0,1072
919,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic diseases such as cancer, idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis, can cause pain that is difficult to control. Pain is one of the most debilitating symptoms and demands increasing doses of analgesics and narcotics, as well as the number of hospital admissions, with a direct implication in the costs of medical treatments. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience with 2 paediatric patients who were subjected to an ultrasound-guided endoscopic celiac ganglion block for difficult pain management, secondary to chronic pancreatitis disease. CLINICAL CASES: The first case concerns a 9-year-old male with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, and the second case is a 12-year-old female who developed episodes of intermittent acute pancreatitis. Both cases suffered from chronic abdominal pain, which was difficult to control with stronger painkillers, such as opioids. The pain decreased after patients were subjected to an ultrasound-guided endoscopic celiac ganglion block. CONCLUSIONS: This technique showed that both patients obtained satisfactory pain relief, with significant improvements in general symptomatology and the stopping of almost all analgesic medication. The authors suggest that celiac ganglion block must be considered, and implemented early before the usual complications, such as a consumption syndrome that is frequent in paediatric patients with chronic pancreatitis.",0,1431
920,"We report a 23 year old woman presenting with a nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease, central diabetes insipidus, primary hypothyroidism, vitiligo and universal alopecia. Eleven years later, she presented secondary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with mild hyperprolactinemia and central adrenal insufficiency. A magnetic resonance imaging of the sella turcica showed a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension that was resected using a transsphenoidal approach. Pathology confirmed the presence of a lymphoplasmacytic hypophysitis. She needed a second surgical resection due to mass growth and neuro-ophthalmologic impairment. One year later, systemic lupus erythematosus, arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were diagnosed. Two years later, due to back pain, constipation and renal failure, retroperitoneal fibrosis was found, satisfactorily treated with glucocorticoids and colchicine. Hence, this clinical vignette shows the coexistence of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome with retroperitoneal fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic hypophysitis. Tissue analysis showed the presence of IgG4 producing plasma cells in the pituitary and retroperitoneum, which constitute a basis for the diagnosis of IgG4 related disease.",0,1261
921,"INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab, an anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy for active Crohn's disease (CD), is associated with increased risks of tuberculosis infection. CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 48 year-old male with active CD on treatment with adalimumab. After three months, he developed a miliary pulmonary tuberculosis infection, with a solitary non-reactive choroidal tubercle temporal-superior to the optic disc being found in an ophthalmological study. Fluorescein angiography showed late hyperfluorescence in a staining pattern. Optic coherence tomography showed a flat mass without serous retinal detachment. The choroidal tubercle slowly regressed with antituberculosis therapy. DISCUSSION: Choroidal tubercles with no vitreo-retinal symptomatology can be present in patients with CD and on treatment with adalimumab.",0,838
922,"In the fourth century, during the Chinese Dong Jin dynasty, the doctor Ge Hong described good results after the oral administration of a suspension prepared from human faeces in patients with severe diarrhoea or food poisoning. Faecal microbiota transplantation has been used for five years in order to treat different diseases in addition to the severe diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile(1). This paper aims to confirm that intestinal microbiota transplantation succeeds in reducing the negative impact of diseases such as severe diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, allergies, metabolic syndrome and others and that it is not only indicated for severe diarrhoea caused by C. difficile. This preliminary study included six patients who underwent faecal microbiota transplantation, aged 83, 76, 66, 37 and 36 years (four men and two women). An improvement in symptoms of 70% was observed. The methodology and criteria to be followed with donors are described and the results are listed in three tables. The methodology followed for the microbiota transplant is the same as that reported by other researchers for the treatment of C. difficile diarrhoea and other diseases. The discussion addresses the issues raised in other parts of the world in handling different pathologic entities, as well as genetic advances. The conclusions show encouraging results.",0,1372
923,"Frontotemporal dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder of which the behavioral variant is most common. This condition is currently considered the most common cause of dementia in people younger than 60 years. Here, we present two unrelated cases in which the typical symptoms were cognitive and behavioral progressive deterioration and psychiatric disorders such as disinhibition, impulsive acts, apathy, lack of empathy, stereotypies, and changes in eating habits. The first case exhibited pathological gambling as the initial symptom and resided in a psychiatric facility for a year. Notably, this was the second such case in Latin America and one of only a few such cases reported worldwide. The second case presented with epileptic seizures during evolution. In both cases, brain magnetic resonance revealed left-predominant frontotemporal atrophy, and alterations in executive function were evident during neuropsychological assessments.",0,943
924,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histological resolution of a case of an inexcisable conjunctival melanoma using topical interferon alpha 2b (INFalpha2b) in a patient with mitomycin C (MMC) intolerance. CASE REPORT: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare, but potentially sight- and life-threatening, tumour. In cases of multiple lesions, or when surgical excision is not possible, topical combination chemotherapy with MMC and INFalpha2b has been described as first line therapy. The case is presented of a 77 year-old woman with a multifocal conjunctival in situ melanoma, who was intolerant to initial treatment with MMC and was switched to long-term INFalpha2b therapy, with a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: When topical MMC is given as chemotherapy treatment for primary acquired melanosis with atypia or in situ melanoma is not well tolerated, switching to INFalpha2b seems to be a good option. This approach could replace surgical management of pigmented tumours, especially the larger ones, with potential benefits that include less dependence on surgical margins. This report prompts a need for prospective studies designed to examine the role of INFalpha2b as primary treatment for heavily pigmented conjunctival tumours avoiding the ocular surface toxicity caused by MMC.",0,1278
925,"Epilepsy surgery is a well-established treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The success of surgery depends on precise presurgical localisation of the epileptogenic zone. There are different techniques to determine its location and extension. Despite the improvements in non-invasive diagnostic tests, in patients for whom these tests are inconclusive, invasive techniques such intraoperative electrocorticography will be needed. Intraoperative electrocorticography is used to guide surgical resection of the epileptogenic lesion and to verify that the resection has been completed. However, it can be affected by some of the anaesthetic drugs used by the anaesthesiologist. Our objective with this case is to review which drugs can be used in epilepsy surgery with intraoperative electrocorticography.",0,817
926,"Neonates and small infants with syndromes characterized by the presence of craniofacial abnormalities may represent great challenges regarding the management of the airway. We describe the case of a 9-day-old neonate with Treacher Collins syndrome, in which a laryngeal mask was essential to improve the airway obstruction, ventilate the patient and serve as an airway conduit for a fiberoptic intubation. By presenting this case, we intend to show that in neonates with Treacher Collins syndrome, in whom difficulties ventilation and intubation are expected, a thoughtful airway management planning is mandatory.",0,613
927,"OBJECTIVE: Purple urine bag syndrome is a rare entity that appears in elderly patients with long-term urinary catheters with chronic diseases. METHOD: We describe the cases of two patients admitted to our service, who serve as example to illustrate this pathology and which process should be followed in its diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: Purple urine bag syndrome is a rare entity that occurs more frequently in elderly patients, women, with long-term urinary catheters, whose main factors are debilitating diseases, prolonged immobility and chronic constipation. It should be treated by avoiding the triggering factors, adequate hydration of the patient, antibiotics directly antibiogram therapy and the change of urinary catheter can be evaluated.",0,756
928,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus 2 has become a global problem. It is estimated that 15% to 25% of patients could develop a chronic ulcer in their life, and nearly 33% of direct care costs of the diabetes mellitus 2 is spent on treating these ulcers. Mesenchymal stem cells have emerged as a promising cell source for the treatment of these ulcers. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 67 year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, and food ulcer chronic involving right foot and part of his leg. He was treated with mesenchymal stem cell management, resulting in skin graft integration and full coverage of the lesion. CONCLUSION: The implementation of mesenchymal stem cell techniques for treatment of chronic ulcer is feasible. The impact on the population would lead to a significant improvement in their quality of life and reduce healthcare spending.",0,895
929,"Dermatologic surgery for tumors affecting only the ciliary region is not very common and it can sometimes be difficult to find published descriptions that deal specifically with surgery to this area. However, reconstruction of the ciliary region is very important, not only because this region is necessary to protect the eye, but also because its position and continuity are of great importance in facial expression, aesthetic appearance, and harmony. We present the cases of patients who have undergone oncologic surgery to the eyebrow region in our department in recent years and review the different techniques proposed for reconstruction of this region.",0,658
930,"A 36 year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with lower extremity numbness, gait instability, and urinary and bowel retention of 4 weeks onset. Spine MRI revealed diffuse oedema of cervicothoracic spinal cord with several solid enhancing intramedullary lesions, suggestive of metastases. The (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed to identify the primary malignancy demonstrated mild hypermetabolic foci within the cervicothoracic cord, as well as a mildly hypermetabolic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and a mildly hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule, suggestive of sarcoidosis versus metastasis. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was supported by identifying non-caseating granuloma in the biopsy of the pulmonary nodule. The patient responded well to steroid-therapy, with the symptoms being resolved within 3 weeks.",0,824
931,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of splenic artery aneurysm is not well known because they are often asymptomatic. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 40 year-old woman diagnosed with a splenic artery aneurysm. She was clinically asymptomatic. A three-dimensional angiographic study was performed. The artery embolisation was rejected, according to the results of the study; thus it was decided to perform a laparoscopic splenic-aneurysmectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic artery aneurysms may present with non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain or anorexia. However 2-10% of aneurysms debut as spontaneous rupture. For this reason treatment is indicated in symptomatic aneurysms or those with rupture risk factors. In these cases there are different possibilities, such as therapeutic embolisation, endovascular stenting or surgery. Surgical approach varies depending on the location of the aneurysm in the splenic artery, enabling aneurysmectomy, splenic-aneurysmectomy, or aneurysm exclusion to be performed.",0,1010
932,"Anatomic variations of the hepatic artery, which occur in 30 to 50% of patients, are a very important factor to be considered for Whipple procedure. The most common variations are those coming from the superior mesenteric artery, left gastric artery and the aorta. We report a 58-year-old woman with a story of one month of epigastric pain, jaundice and progressive itching. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass in the head of the pancreas. During pancreatoduodenectomy a left hepatic artery (LHA) emerging from the gastroduodenal artery and an accessory LHA emerging from the left gastric artery, were observed. The rest of the surgery was performed with no incidents. The patient had an uneventful postoperative evolution.",0,728
933,"Dermatomyositis causes inflammation and damage of muscle and skin, and sometimes involves internal organs, especially lung parenchyma. Patients with dermatomyositis still represent a diagnostic challenge because of the rarity of this disease and the lack of specificity of some of its cutaneous manifestations. Herein, we describe the case of a patient with dermatomyositis, initially diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis, in which the performance of anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies was decisive to establish a definitive diagnosis.",0,562
934,"Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis has recently been classified as an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by episodes of systemic inflammation including serological signs of inflammation occurring in the absence of autoantibodies or pathogen agents. The insidious onset of pain with swelling and tenderness localized over the affected bones are the main manifestations. The metaphysis and epiphyses of the long bones, clavicle and vertebrae are affected. We report a male patient aged 2 years and 2 months with osteomyelitis with lytic destruction in two different single sites with a year difference between the episodes. Histological examination of the bone showed inflammation and chronic osteomyelitis, excluding the existence of infectious osteomyelitis, neoplasm and myeloproliferative disease. Clinical symptoms improved under treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Considering chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis may shorten time to diagnosis in order to avoid potentially unnecessary prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, complementary studies and multiple biopsies.",0,1116
935,"OBJECTIVE: Cases of septic arthritis in paediatric population by Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Health Area of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) were reviewed. METHODS: A retrospective study from January 2005 to March 2014 was conducted for all S. pneumoniae isolates obtained from joint fluids in children. RESULTS: From the 7,416 joint fluids received in the Microbiology Department, 77 belonged to paediatric patients, and of these, only 8 had positive culture. In total, there were three positive cases for S. pneumoniae, two with positive culture and a third with positive antigen detection. In the three patients (two of them under 15 months) the affected joint was hip, antibiotic treatment was combined with surgical drainage and evolution was favourable. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pneumococcal arthritis is an entity that must be taken into account since most cases of arthritis in paediatric population appear as a complication of bacteraemia after a common cold or an ear infection. The greatest risk of sequel is associated with delays in diagnosis, so it is essential clinical and microbiological early diagnosis.",0,1128
936,"Human toxocarosis is a chronic larval parasitosis listed as one of the five most important neglected diseases by the CDC. The larvae can spread systemically and migrate to different tissues including liver and gallbladder. Acalculous acute cholecystitis (AAC) is a rare disease in children.

937,"Sclerochoroidal calcification (SCC) is uncommon and benign. It is usually detected in a routine examination, finding multiple yellow-white lesions in the upper temporal region of the retina in middle-aged and elderly men. A case report is presented of a 79 year-old male patient, who during a routine examination with a pseudoexfoliative glaucoma in the right eye, as well as raised white-yellow subretinal lesions in the upper temporal region in both eyes. After establishing hypotensive treatment and performing autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound, ocular computed tomography (CT) and complete laboratory analysis, idiopathic SCC was diagnosed. SCC requires a complete ophthalmological and systemic study as it can be associated with endocrine disease. Periodic follow-up is also recommended, as well as to rule out possible complications, such as atrophy of the overlying pigment epithelium, serous detachment, or the appearance of neovascularization. The differential diagnosis should be made of benign and malignant lesions, in order to avoid unnecessary treatment.",0,1099

Treatment with plasmapheresis, haemodialysis and systemic eculizumab led to the blood and urine parameters returning to normal, as well as resolution of the retinal anomalies. Genetic analysis show both mutations in complement factor H and C3. DISCUSSION: Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Atypical HUS is caused by genetic mutation of complement system. Ocular involvement is an unusual manifestation of this rare syndrome.",0,760
940,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause upper respiratory tract and occasionally lower respiratory tract diseases. The recently described human coronavirus NL63 has not been well investigated among Brazilian patients. We reported the clinical course of an HCoV-NL63 infection in a hospitalised patient suspected of H1N1 2009 infection during the second pandemic wave of influenza activity. A 46-year-old female, health care worker with diabetes and presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) was admitted to the hospital. During 9 days of influenza-like symptoms, the patient had diabetes decompensation, haemorrhagic pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory and renal failure, pericarditis, and brain edema and died. HCoV-NL63 may be a causative agent of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses.",1,795
941,"Endoscopic transforaminal discectomy is a minimally invasive technique used for the surgical treatment of herniated discs. Indigocarmine is a dye which is widely used to identify the ureteral orifice in urologic procedures. Hemodynamic effects such as hypotension and anaphylaxis in addition to hypertension, bradycardia and atrioventricular block have been reported in intravenous application of indigocarmine. The aim of this case report is to prepare anesthesiologists for such cases and make them consider invasive blood pressure monitorization. Both patients had radicular pain radiating to the leg and scheduled to undergo transforaminal endoscopic discectomy. Intraoperative vital signs were within normal limits, however severe hypertension and tachyarrhythmia developed following the injection. Hemodynamics in both patients returned to normal following lidocaine and nitroglycerine injection.",0,902
942,"CASE REPORT: A 6 year-old girl with juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) and bilateral complicated anterior uveitis developed several ocular complications that required 5 surgical procedures. Despite the aggressive course of ocular inflammation, her visual acuity remained good. Arthritis (main criterion for the diagnosis of JPsA) appeared years after ocular involvement. She showed a good anti-tumour necrosis factor initial response. DISCUSSION: The definitive diagnosis of JPsA was established years after the onset of symptoms. In addition, the patient maintained a good visual acuity, despite its complicated disease course. Finally, she showed a good clinical response to adalimumab.",0,689
943,"Heterotopic pancreas is a silent gastrointestinal malformation that may become clinically evident when complicated by inflammation and pseudocyst formation. We report a 26 year-old male presenting with vomiting, pain and abdominal distention. An abdominal CT scan showed an important gastric distention secondary to a 4-cm cystic lesion located in the antrum wall. An endosonography showed that the lesion obstructed the gastric outlet and was compatible with a pseudocyst. A cysto-gastrostomy was performed draining the cyst. Its high lipase and amylase content confirmed that it was a pancreatic pseudocyst. Six months later, the lesion appeared again and a subtotal gastrectomy was performed Histopathology confirmed ectopic pancreatic tissue.",0,746
944,"Narratives play a fundamental role in the recovery of persons with schizophrenia, mainly from the paradigmatic change engendered by the recovery movement. Rather than a methodological tool or a byproduct of recovery, narratives are integral components of this process. This article aims to analyze overcoming narratives, in the light of the corporeality paradigm, based on an emblematic case of a peer support worker. This is a qualitative study carried out in the context of a randomized clinical trial, and it is based on one in-depth interview and focus groups for the construction of the narrative. Thematic analysis was carried out and the following categories were identifed: sense of self and embodiment; experience of time and space; relationship with others; illness experience and overcoming. The embodied narratives of overcoming constitute in the register of a non-linear temporality, and it is based on a dialectical and dialogic process of construction/reconstruction of the sense of self and of the body itself. We propose that embodied narratives are considered as a methodological principle for narrative analysis on recovery, as well as an intrinsic dimension of the recovery journey; that is, as the center of gravity of the process of construction / reconstruction of the sense of self, embodiment and the sense of belonging to the world.",0,1358
945,"OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Our objective is to describe a multifocal vitelliform presentation of Best's disease. The lesions in this disease may vary in size and shape, some may be a disc diameter in size, and often have some irregularity in their contour. The case is described of a 21-year-old male patient referred to our ophthalmology department due to a progressive loss of vision. His poor visual acuity was confirmed, and a complete examination was performed, in which macular flecks were observed, with yellow pigment arranged in oval distribution near their periphery. Due to the suspicion of Best's multifocal disease, genetic tests were performed. Multifocal vitelliform disease with the same features as those in Best's disease occurs most frequently in patients with a normal electro-oculogram (EOG), and a normal family history. CONCLUSION: Best's multifocal disease must be suspected in case of multiple vitelliruptive lesions close to the posterior pole. Genetic testing is essential for its diagnosis.",0,1015

947,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 51-year old male patient with a history of blunt trauma in the frontal region and a one-year history of vision loss, proptosis and paresis of the lateral rectus muscle of the right eye. A right ethmoid and bilateral sphenoid mucocele was diagnosed. Drainage was performed using an external and endoscopic approach with improvement in symptoms without recurrence at 10 months. DISCUSSION: Sphenoid mucoceles represent 1% of all mucoceles and may present with different clinical manifestations. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, and early intervention is indicated to prevent complications.",0,640
948,"INTRODUCTION: Infantile-onset Pompe disease is a kind of glycogenosis resulting from a deficit of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Before specific enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) became available, the classic form was fatal during the first two years of life. ERT increases survival and improves cardiac, respiratory and motor functioning. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: 2-month-old infant with predominantly axial hypotonia who required the use of a nasogastric tube as a result of difficulties in sucking and swallowing. Myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were observed. The patient was diagnosed with Pompe disease, ERT was established and improved heart and motor functioning were noted. Nevertheless, she presented recurring respiratory infections that finally made it necessary to perform a tracheostomy. She is currently still undergoing ERT, walks with a walker and presents a mild ventricular dysfunction. Case 2: 3-week-old infant who was taken to see his paediatrician for a routine check-up. The examination revealed a systolic bruit and axial and proximal hypotonia. Cardiology tests revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient was sent to a referral centre, where he was diagnosed with Pompe disease and a cross-reactive immunological material-negative status. The patient received immunomodulator treatment and ERT. Progress was favourable, although he presented frequent respiratory infections. The patient is currently capable of walking by himself, although the gait is unsteady. CONCLUSIONS: Both cases illustrate the new phenotype of infantile-onset Pompe disease treated with ERT. Despite the motor limitations and respiratory involvement presented by the patients, both survival and autonomy have increased.",0,1735
949,"Monoarticular tuberculosis of the wrist is a rare presentation of primary tuberculosis, being more common skeletal forms involving the spine. Extraspinal tuberculous osteomyelitis is rare and comprises only 2 to 3% of all cases of osteoarticular Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. We present a case of a 49 years old female patient, who worked as an hospital cleaning employed without other comorbidity. After a low energy injury of the wrist she suffered pain syndrome diagnosticated as a flexor tendinopathy, managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and physical therapy. Eight months later patient evolves with chronic pain in range of motion of right wrist joint, leading to a complete radiological, surgical biopsy and cultures. Histology, and molecular biology confirmed the wrist joint tuberculosis diagnosis. Pharmacological treatment and physical therapy were initiated with appropriated response.",0,918
950,"A 49 year-old woman diagnosed with infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma, underwent a right mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy (SLNB). The resected sentinel lymph nodes were negative for malignancy, with an axillary lymphadenectomy not being performed. In the early post-operative period, the patient reported an axillary skin tension sensation, associated with a painful palpable cord. These are typical manifestations of axillary web syndrome (AWS), a poorly known axillary surgery complication, from both invasive and conservative interventions. By presenting this case we want to focus the attention on a pathological condition, for which its incidence may be underestimated by not including it in SLNB studies. It is important for nuclear medicine physicians to be aware of AWS as a more common complication than infection, seroma, or lymphoedema, and to discuss this possible event with the patient who is consenting to the procedure.",0,941

952,"We describe a group of patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and joint involvement. Between February 2011 and January 2012, there were six cases in our unit. Two presented with a pattern similar to rheumatoid arthritis, three had polyarthralgia with an inflammatory pattern and only one patient had asymmetrical oligoarthritis of large joints. They were all women aged between 25 and 75 (4 were of child-bearing potential). Diagnosis in all the cases was made by exclusion of other possible causes and negative IgM were obtained for the rest of the ""Herpesviridae"" family viruses. In our series, EBV joint involvement was more common in women of childbearing potential. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous but was predominantly in the form of inflammatory joint pain. When it presents in the form of symmetrical polyarthritis, it can become chronic and require the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.",0,926
953,"Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection which is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Erythema migrans, a rash spreading from the site of a tick bite, is the earliest and most common manifestation of the disease. If untreated, late manifestations of disseminated disease, mainly neurological and musculoskeletal, may occur. Serologic studies are usually negative in early stages and are not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in cases of erythema migrans. Laboratory confirmation is needed for disseminated disease. Most presentations, including facial nerve palsy, can be treated with oral antibiotics. Ceftriaxone is recommended in other cases of neuroborreliosis. Four cases of Lyme disease in children are reported to illustrate the different presentations of this disease and its management in children.",0,819
954,"Elbow dislocation in children is a very infrequent traumatic event which was first described by Stimson in 1900 and then by Tachdjian in 1990. Its estimated incidence ranges from 3% to 6% of all elbow injuries, peaking at 13-14 years. Elbow trauma is classified considering the direction in which the proximal radioulnar joint shifts with respect to the humerus, into posterior and anterior dislocation. The former is the most frequent and accounts for 95% of cases. Elbow fracture dislocation is an even rarer event. The incidence rate of avulsion fracture of the medial epicondyle is 25-36%, of the lateral condyle 4%, of the olecranon 1.7%, of the radial head 8%, of the coronoid process 3.5%, and others, 3.5%. At present there is no consensus in the literature on how to treat this type of lesions, particularly because some authors advocate nonsurgical management, while others propose surgical management as the definitive treatment. What is clear, however, is that a late diagnosis or untimely treatment may affect the child's growth and lead to serious complications. The purpose of this study is to share our experience and good results with the surgical management of these infrequent cases.",0,1202

A pericardial window was made and during the operation the surgeons observed that the myocardium was diffusely infiltrated. Twenty-eight months before, ECD was clinically diagnosed and prednisone and methotrexate were prescribed. Due to disease progression which culminated in the cardiac tamponade, methotrexate was changed to sirolimus aiming to obtain plasma levels between 5-8 ng/ml. This treatment stabilized his cardiac function allowing a survival of 52 months after its initiation, with fewer side effects.",0,671
957,"Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas are rather common in daily practice. The aim of the surgical treatment is closure of the leak, but recurrences are quite frequent. The association between spontaneous CSF fistulas and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is not uncommon, and this is probably the cause of the low rate of success of the surgical treatment. Symptoms of IIH associated with spontaneous CSF fistula are atypical, and diagnosis is often missed. Continuous intracranial pressure monitoring is very useful in the diagnosis of chronic IIH and in patients with spontaneous CSF fistula, as it helps in making decisions on the treatment of these patients.",0,681
958,"INTRODUCTION: Presumed solitary circumscribed retinal astrocytic proliferation (PSCRAP) is a small defined solitary lesion. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man had an opaque yellow retinal lesion inferonasal to the optic disc. Fluorescein angiography showed mild early hyperfluorescence and late fluorescence. Ultrasound showed no calcification. Autofluorescence disclosed moderate hyperautofluorescence. Optical coherence tomography showed the mass with a snowball configuration and a smooth surface. More than one year later, the lesion was unchanged. DISCUSSION: PSCRAP is a benign stable lesion. The main importance lies in its differentiation from well-circumscribed yellow-white lesions of the retina.",0,702
959,"BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma of soft tissues in childhood and adolescence, with an annual incidence of 4-7 cases per million children aged 15. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is common in adults younger than 30 years, and are usually presented as a large painless, palpable mass (> 5cm). Survival in the case of paratesticular sarcoma in men is approximately 50%. CLINICAL CASE: Male 27 years of age with no history of importance, was seen in a clinic with an increased, painless, left testicular volume 3 years onset. Intrascrotal left testicle increased volume, with dimensions of 20x12x8cm, a stone and left inguinal node in induratum measuring 2x2cm. Microscopically, it showed a pattern of an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma with left inguinal node metastases. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of testicular tumours, and especially of primary intratesticular rhabdomyosarcomas, and aggressive surgical treatment in combination with chemotherapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence and may improve the rate of disease-free survival and overall survival in adult patients with metastases.",0,1109
960,"CLINICAL CASE: A 27-year-old woman with a history of nyctalopia and constriction of visual field of the right eye. The ophthalmological examination showed a visual field and electroretinogram that were compatible with unilateral retinitis pigmentosa (RP). After a one year follow-up, the unilateral condition remained. DISCUSSION: Unilateral retinitis pigmentosa is a rare condition, with a frequency between 0.2%-5% of the RP. It mainly affects women and older age groups than bilateral RP. For a definitive diagnosis, it is necessary to have a funduscopy and electroretinogram (ERG) altered unilaterally, and exclude infectious, inflammatory, and vascular causes.",0,665
962,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral ptosis is understood as the bilateral paralysis of eyelid elevation linked to a stroke or hemorrhage of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). It is a transient condition, independent of the evolution of the lesion. AIM: To analyze six patients with the condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Report of five women and one male aged 42 to 72 years. RESULTS: All suffered an infarction or hemorrhage in the territory of the middle cerebral artery of the non-dominant hemisphere and developed a bilateral palpebral ptosis. The recovery started after the fourth day. At the tenth day, eye opening was effortless and did not require frontal help, despite the persistence of hemiplegia. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral ptosis is a mimetic dysfunction of a specific non-injured area of the cerebral cortex, originated from a nearby parenchymal damage such as the middle cerebral artery of the same hemisphere. Cerebral ptosis expresses the inhibition of the voluntary eyelid elevation center, of prefrontal location in the non-dominant hemisphere.",0,1040
964,"CASE REPORT: A case is presented of a right frontoethmoidal osteoma with intraorbital invasion in a 43-year-old male, who was seen in the clinic with a proptosis, retro-orbital pain, peri-palpebral inflammation, and binocular diplopia due to muscular route limitation. Open surgery was performed using a subcranial approach, with removal of several fragments of osteoma. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis.

They are usually asymptomatic until mass effect complications occur in the brain or in the orbit, or locally, generating mucoceles due to sinus drainage obstruction.",0,654
965,"Saprochaete capitata (S. capitata) fungal sepsis is a severe condition with a clinical presentation that is similar to other yeast originated fungal sepsis. It is observed in patients with hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and neutropenia. We report a 23 year old male presenting with cough, fever and malaise. A bone marrow biopsy led to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. During the first cycle of chemotherapy the patient presented fever: blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite antimicrobial treatment, fever persisted; a computed tomography showed a focal splenic lesion; a left exudative pleural effusion appeared. A Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry identified the presence of S. capitata.

966,"WHIM syndrome is a primary autosomal dominant immuno deficiency due to CXCR4 mutations characterized by mucocutaneous warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections and myelokathesis. Treatment consists in prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement and granulocyte or granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factors. We present the case of a 21 year old woman who showed leukopenia at 10 months of age and one year later multiple infections with hypogammaglobulinemia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin. During follow up she developed chronic neutropenia. A bone marrow aspiration showed increased myeloid series with predominance of immature elements. On the basis of infections, low levels of IgG, IgA, IgM and lymphopenia with absent memory B cells, a diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency was made. She started intravenous immunoglobulin replacement and prophylactic antibiotics. At age 20, small warts in hands that progressed to forearms, knees, abdomen and face were recorded. CXCR4 gene sequencing was done detecting a heterozygous p.Arg334STOP mutation, confirming WHIM syndrome. This disease is infrequent and difficult to diagnose.",0,1176

968,"INTRODUCTION: Rapidly progressive dementias are an infrequent group of diseases characterised by cognitive deterioration and other neurological disorders that develop over a period ranging from weeks to months. Their causation is varied and includes a large number of neurodegenerative, toxic, metabolic, autoimmune, infectious and vascular conditions. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 69-year-old male who was admitted to hospital due to a rapidly progressive dementia and parkinsonism caused by multiple dural arteriovenous fistulas, which were successfully treated by means of endovascular therapy. CONCLUSION: Dural arteriovenous fistulas are anomalous connections between the dural arteries and the venous sinuses or cortical veins that are an unusual cause of rapidly progressive dementia. They must, however, be taken into account, given the availability of a specific treatment with reversal of the symptoms.",0,920
969,"Cervical and vaginal cytology, Papanicolaou test (PAP), is the most effective test for screening of preneoplastic lesions, and cervical cancer prevention. Its sensitivity goes from 50 to 98%, according to different statistics, and this variation is related to the sampling procedure. A satisfactory smear should be taken from the transformation zone, the junction between endocervix and exocervix. According to Bethesda, metaplastic and/or endocervical cells should be observed under the microscope. The traditional PAP smear includes an exo-endocervical sampling using the Ayre spatula; however, only near 50% of the smears are representative of the transformation zone. In this case report, we present the case of a 40-year-old woman who had negative cytology in five consecutive annual PAP smears, none of which showed metaplastic or endocervical cells. A new sample evidenced a carcinoma in situ (HSIL: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). We emphasize the importance of performing a correct exo-endocervical sampling to allow prompt detection of all premalignant lesions and to prevent cervical cancer, which still persists with high mortality worldwide.",0,1167
970,"BACKGROUND: Nail-Patella syndrome (NPS) (OMIM: 161200) or hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal anomalies, nail dysplasia, renal and ocular abnor malities. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings and confirmed by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the LMX1B gene. Management of these patients involves conti nuous follow-up and treatment ofthe orthopedical, ocular and renal problems that mayoccur. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of NPS with short stature and hypothyroidism, an association that has not been described in the literature. CASE REPORT: An eleven-year-old boy with a height of 130 cm (-2.01 Stan dard Deviations [SD]) was referred to the Endocrine Unit at the age of 2 years due to altered thyroid tests. At that time, dysplastic nails and disproportionate short stature were detected. Radiological abnormalities initially suggested a skeletal dysplasia. A primary hypothyroidism was confirmed, without anti-thyroid antibodies and with a normal thyroid ultrasound. Levothyroxine treatment was initiated. The diagnosis of NPS was confirmed by a genetic study with a single pathogenic variant in the LMX1B gene. His father presented a similar phenotype with normal stature. His bone age was equivalent to his chronological age. Laboratory screening for short stature and a GH stimulation test were normal. CONCLUSION: We present a child with proven NPS with short stature and hypothyroi dism. We did not find publications that described this triple association. It can't be ruled out that there could be a relationship between NPS and the thyroid alterations found in this patient.",0,1692

973,"Alagille's syndrome is an infrequent genetic condition with autosomal inheritance and variable expression. The complete form exhibits 5 clinical signs, chronic intrahepatic cholestasis, characteristic facies, cardiovascular anomalies, posterior embryotoxon, and vertebral defects. If only 3 or 4 of these are present the case is considered as an incomplete form. The association of Alagille's syndrome with radio-ulnar synostosis is extremely rare. There is only one case described in the indexed literature. A case is presented of Alagille's syndrome with bilateral proximal radioulnar synostosis. To the best of our knowledge this is the second reported case of this association.",0,681
974,"Stroke in childhood is considered rare. It may be ischemic or hemorrhagic. Its presentation is often acute and it is a leading cause of mortality in pediatrics. The aim of our work is to present the general features of stroke of 18 patients under 15 years of age admitted to the Hospital El Cruce, between July 2009 and June 2014, and their clinical outcome a year later. We observed a predominance of male patients and the median age of 5 years. The main clinical features were hemiparesis, seizures, headache and vomiting and sensory impairment. The most frequent type was ischemic and the middle cerebral artery territory was the most commonly involved. Twelve patients had no sequelae. The signs and symptoms were guiding stroke, neuroimaging studies were essential for diagnosis and patients evolved favorably with low number of recurrence and death.",0,855

976,"Pheochromocytomas are tumors that arise from chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system and act by synthesizing and releasing catecholamines. They usually occur between the fourth and fifth decade of life and have a very wide clinical presentation. They occur only in 0.1-0.2% of the hypertensive population and represent a treatable and curable cause of arterial hypertension, as well as other symptoms derived from the uncontrolled secretion of catecholamines.

978,"INTRODUCTION: Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug mainly used to treat epilepsy. Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy due to VPA is a rare but serious complication. The mechanism by which VPA influences the increase in ammonia consists in blocking the urea cycle, thereby inhibiting N-acetylglutamate synthase and diminishing acetyl coenzyme A. Generally, the treatment employed has been to withdraw VPA and to administer arginine, carnitine, antibiotics, glucose and protein restriction. Previous experience with carglumic acid is limited to reports of isolated cases of paediatric patients. CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of two adult patients with encephalopathy due to VPA who were treated with carglumic acid, in addition to the conventional measures. Following treatment with the drug, ammonia levels can be seen to return to normal values. In one of the two cases, owing to the existence of another cause of encephalopathy, no clinical improvement was observed. CONCLUSIONS: From the biochemical point of view, treating encephalopathy due to VPA with carglumic acid is a logical step, as it reverses the blockage of the urea cycle conditioned by VPA. The mechanism proposed as being the one by which brain toxicity and, therefore, encephalopathy are produced is the passage of ammonia in the form of glutamine to the inside of the cell, which then returns to ammonia and glutamate in the mitochondria and leads to oxidative stress. Carglumic acid must be considered an important part of the treatment in adult patients with hyperammonaemic encephalopathy due to VPA, although a randomised clinical trial needs to be conducted with the drug in order to test its efficacy.",0,1668
979,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The care plan of a 42-year-old woman with anaphylactic shock, secondary to ingestion of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, with upper airway involvement due to laryngeal angioedema, is presented. Previously she had had two episodes of angioedema of unknown origin. The incidence of this phenomenon is between 3.2 and 10 cases/100,000 people/year. CLINICAL OBSERVATION: An evaluation was made and three altered necessities stood out: breathing and circulation (she needed mechanical ventilation and noradrenalin perfusion), elimination (she required furosemide to keep an acceptable diuresis time), and hygiene and skin protection (she presented generalised hyperaemia, lip, lingual and oropharyngeal oedema). The hospital's Clinical Research Ethics Committee requested the patient's informed consent to access her clinical history. INTERVENTIONS: According to the altered necessities, seven diagnoses were prioritised according to NANDA taxonomy: risk of allergic response, risk of infection, risk of ineffective renal perfusion, decreased cardiac output, impaired spontaneous ventilation, risk of unstable blood glucose level, and risk of dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Scores of outcome criteria showed a favourable evolution after 24hours. The development of a standardised NANDA-NOC-NIC language in the clinical case presented allowed us to organise the nursing work, facilitating recording and normalising clinical practice. As a limitation of this case, we didn't have serial plasma levels of histamine and tryptase to assess the evolution of anaphylactic symptoms.

982,"Citrullinemia type I is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the gene expressing ASS1 argininosuccinate synthetase, limiting enzyme of the urea cycle. The classic variants are associated with neonatal/infantile forms that cause hyperammonemia leading to death if treatment is not established. Initial symptoms of disorders of the urea cycle include neurological impairment with mild or moderate liver damage. We report a case of recurrent liver failure in an infant diagnosed with type I citrullinemia without severe neurological involvement that was referred to our center for liver transplantation. Acute liver failure can be caused by a wide range of disorders in which inborn errors of metabolism are included. Appropriate treatment of disorders of the urea cycle and in particular citrullinemia I can avoid the need for a transplant.",0,855
983,"A common complication in paediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) is hyperlipidaemia. About 20% of children do not respond to treatment with corticosteroids, presenting with a cortico-resistant NS (CRNS), which can progress to kidney failure. It has been observed that paediatric patients with CRNS have an elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-c), and triglycerides levels, as well as elevated Lipoprotein-a [Lp (a)] levels. The case is presented of a 5 year old boy, diagnosed with CRNS, presenting with dyslipidaemia with increased LDL-c, Apo-B100, and Lp(a) levels. After the poor prognosis of the renal function, immunosuppressant treatment was started with tacrolimus and atorvastatin to control dyslipidaemia. Although tacrolimus causes an elevation of total cholesterol and LDL-c, the significant alterations of the children lipid profile suggest the existence of a high cardiovascular risk. In these cases, it would be interesting to have reference values in children in our health area.",0,1067
984,"BACKGROUND: Acute gastric volvulus is a rare, but potentially life-threatening, cause of upper gastrointestinal obstruction. CLINICAL CASE: Male of 60 years old with severe epigastric pain and abdominal distension with haematemesis on two occasions. The patient was haemodynamically stable, with abdominal distension and palpable epigastric fullness. Hematic cytology showed: haemoglobin 8.2g/dl and haematocrit 27%. Abdominal X-ray showed an elevation of left diaphragm with a hugely dilated stomach. A nasogastric tube was inserted. Endoscopy was performed. There was no active bleeding, but it was impossible to reach the duodenum due to the stomach distortion. The upper gastrointestinal X-ray study showed the appearance of an inverted stomach in the chest and an organoaxial gastric torsion. The CT scans of thorax and abdomen showed a gastric ascent into the thoracic cavity. Laparoscopic surgery was performed, finding the left hemi-diaphragm elevated, and the stomach, splenic angle of the colon, the spleen and tail of the pancreas were also raised. A linear gastrectomy (gastric sleeve) was performed. The postoperative progress was satisfactory. Oral feeding was started 72 hours after surgery, and the patient was discharged, and has remained asymptomatic during the following by 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physicians must maintain a high level of suspicion in patients that present with signs and symptoms suggesting upper digestive tract occlusion. The gastric sleeve is an excellent alternative to avoid recurrence of gastric volvulus.",0,1556
985,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is immune-mediated. It occurs more frequently with unfractionated heparin (UFH) than with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). It is associated with thromboembolic rather than hemorrhagic events, as opposed to thrombocytopenia of other etiologies. The key in therapy is the cessation of heparin and the start of another anticoagulant. We report a 58 years old female with HIT secondary to the use of Enoxaparin who was successfully managed with Rivaroxaban. Our goal is to report a novel therapy and provide the evidence that supports its use.",0,583
986,"Psoas abscess is a common disease in children. It can have a nonspecific clinical presentation, insidious onset and sometimes fever. The most common type in children is the primary one; however, it can sometimes be of secondary origin and associated with severe infections such as osteomyelitis so a high index of suspicion is required to detect and treat it promptly. We present an unusual case of psoas abscess with infiltration of the vertebral body of L2 in a 14 year old male patient previously healthy with no history of trauma or fever on admission. X-ray and ultrasound were performed but the diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine. With positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus he completed 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy and 4 weeks of oral antibiotic therapy with blood cultures negativization and resolution of symptoms.",0,914
987,"CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns a 34 year-old man, who presented with pain in the medial canthus in his left eye, with proptosis and diplopia. The examination showed exophthalmus and a palpable mass at the inner canthus. The computed tomography revealed a lesion, which was confirmed by biopsy to be a ossifying fibroma. DISCUSSION: Ossifying fibroma is a benign fibro-osseous lesion that mostly affects the jaw. Clinical presentation and complications vary according to its location. Clinical examination, imaging, and histopathology are essential for definitive diagnosis. Surgical treatment is multidisciplinary and long-term follow up is needed.",0,650
988,"BACKGROUND: The gallbladder volvulus is defined as the rotation of the gallbladder on its mesentery along the axis of the cystic duct and cystic artery. It is an extremely rare surgical disease and definitive diagnosis is usually made during surgery. CASE REPORT: A 78 year old woman presented with upper right quadrant abdominal pain, with no comorbidities and no other accompanying symptoms. Analysis revealed haemodynamic instability and leukocytosis. Computed tomography of abdomen showed an acute cholecystitis. During emergency right hypochondrium laparotomy, the gallbladder was found to be twisted counterclockwise with huge gangrenous gallbladder distal. Open cholecystectomy was performed and after the surgery, the patient was discharged in a few days. CONCLUSION: Gallbladder volvulus, or gallbladder torsion, is a rare condition and should be considered when clinical and imaging findings of complicated cholecystitis are present. The performance of urgent laparoscopic surgery would be first option to avoid perforation, peritonitis and haemodynamic instability.",0,1076
989,"OBJECTIVE: We describe a simplified method to detect anterior lenticonus. Three eyes of 2 patients with anterior lenticonus, plus 16 eyes from 16 healthy controls underwent Scheimpflug imaging of their anterior segment with Pentacam. The anterior capsule apex angle was manually identified and automatically measured by AutoCAD. RESULTS: The mean angle was 173.06 degrees (SD: 1.91) in healthy subjects, and 158.33 degrees (SD: 3.05) in anterior lenticonus eyes. The angle obtained from patients was more than 3 SD steeper than those from healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The apical angle calculation method seems to discriminate well between normal eyes and eyes suspected of having anterior lenticonus.",0,702
990,"Spontaneous rupture of the urinary excretory system is a rare condition. It is mainly associated with obstruction of the excretory system and is usually unilateral. We report a 58 years old male who, during the performance of a computed tomography of the urinary system, felt an intense lumbar pain. A bilateral rupture at the level of the fornix was found. The patient had an uneventful evolution thereafter. Fifteen days later a new computed tomography showed indemnity of the urinary excretory system.",0,504
991,"INTRODUCTION: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/T), nasal type, is an infrequent neoplasm with a high lethality, characterized by bone destruction around the sinus, nasal septum or obstruction of the airway. Also, may be primary skin involvement, airway and other organs. Objecti ve: Submit a rare condition in the pediatric population, in order to facilitate the diagnostic suspicion and quick recognition from specialists. CASE REPORT: a 14-year-old girl, who presented arm and leg lesions, painless, suggestive of subcutaneous panniculitis, which evolve to ulcerated purple maculae. Skin biopsy showed lesion compatible with NK/T lymphoma, nasal type. She was referred to pedia tric oncology, where she received chemotherapy treatment. Despite medical efforts, the patient died eight months after due to a serious pulmonary infection secondary to immunosuppression. Conclu sions: Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is a rare neoplasm that behaves aggressively, with high mortality without treatment, therefore, its recognition has a high importance for early diagnosis and prompt referral to Hematology-Oncology.",0,1135
992,"Chikungunya virus infection is a disease transmitted by vectors, in which vertical transmission was described in years 2005-2006. An infection rate up to 49% in neonates born from mothers with active viremia during labor has been observed. Perinatal infection could results in serious complications and potential cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To describe a newborn with Chikungunya virus infection secundary to vertical transmission. Clinical case: A female newborn is analyzed. She presented with fever and exanthema during her first week of life, elevation of transaminases and thrombocytopenia. Her mother had had symptoms compatible with chikungunya virus infection on the day of the delivery. Specific IgM antibodies against chikungunya were documented and the diagnosis was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Given the high perinatal transmissibility rate of chikungunya virus, this diagnosis should be considered in every newborn child of a mother with suggestive symptoms of chikungunya in the days surrounding delivery.",0,1019
993,"INTRODUCTION: Perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) is a cell type constantly present in a group of tumours including angiomyolipoma (AML), clear-cell <<sugar>> tumour (CCST) of the lung and extrapulmonary sites, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and clear-cell tumours of other anatomical sites. It has morphologic distinctive features: epithelioid appearance with a clear to granular cytoplasm, a round to oval, centrally located nucleus and an inconspicuous nucleolus. Immunohistochemically, PEC expresses myogenic and melanocytic markers. Eleven cases of primary bone PEComa presentation have been described since 2002. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of primary bone perivascular epithelioid cell tumour. CASE REPORT: 24 year-old male presented with pain. X-ray revealed an osteolytic lesion at right proximal tibia with soft tissue extension. Evaluation of slides identified a bony perivascular epithelioid cell tumour without immunohistochemical study confirmation. RESULTS: Patient was treated by surgical excision and adjuvant chemotherapy (epirubicin/cysplatin). After two years of follow-up the patient remains disease free. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first-case report in Latin America. Immunohistochemical stains were negative and we believe it may be due to non-described ethnic variations.",0,1294
994,"Dent's disease is a rare X-linked recessive tubulopathy characterized by low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrolcalcinosis or nephrolithiasis, proximal tubular dysfunction and renal failure in adulthood. Females are carriers and usually mildly affected. Progression to endstage renal failure are at the 3rd-5th decades of life in 30-80% of affected males. In the absence of therapy targeting for the molecular defect, the current care of patients with Dent's disease is supportive, focusing on the prevention of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.

995,"A schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor derived from Schwann cells. They are usually small and solitary tumors more frequently localized in cranial nerves and the spinal cord and rarely in the limbs. Some cases have been reported involving extremities (mainly the upper ones) but with a small size. Cases of big size schwannomas unrelated to a neurofibromatosis are very rare. We report the case of a 25 year old patient, with a giant schwannoma which invaded the ischiatic region reaching the triceps surae.",0,512
996,"CLINICAL CASE: A 14 year-old boy with Coats' disease in his right eye, presented with a visual acuity (VA) of 0.1, micro-aneurysms, exudates, a macular oedema of 959 microns, and peripheral telangiectasias. After 12 months follow-up with 6 ranibizumab injections and 3 sessions of argon laser photocoagulation, the macular oedema remained and VA was 0.2. Following 4 aflibercept injections and another 2 laser sessions, he had a good foveal slope and a VA of 0.5, with no recurrences in the last 12 months.

997,"CASE REPORT: A 47 year-old woman with a choroidal melanoma developed a macular oedema secondary to radiation therapy 75 months after brachytherapy plaque. The patient received 3 intravitreal Bevacizumab injections. DISCUSSION: The patient had a good response to bevacizumab treatment. In fact, there was a reduction in the macular oedema measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan, as well as an improvement in best corrected visual acuity. There was no recurrence of macular oedema, and visual acuity remained stable after 3-years follow-up.",0,551
998,"CASE REPORT: An 84 year-old woman with persistent epithelial defect and a dense stromal infiltrate post-corneal transplantation. According to the microbiological results, it was due to a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) resistant to all antibiotics except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Healing was achieved after three weeks of treatment with oral and topical TMP/SMX. DISCUSSION: S. maltophilia is an opportunistic microorganism rarely described in ophthalmology. It is associated with conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, dacryrocystitis, cellulitis, and endophthalmitis with significant morbidity. Treatment is complicated because of its resistances to broad-spectrum antibiotics. TMP/SMX monotherapy can be considered an option of treatment for this type of keratitis.",0,797
999,OBJECTIVE: To report the ability of bone morphogenetic protein to achieve bone healing in patients with congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients with a diagnosis of congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia were followed-up for six months. Bone healing and functional capacity of the limb were observed.

1000,"This article tends to illustrate the coordination mechanisms used through an example centred on a case study of a 65 year-old patient who presents obesity, hypertension, high cardiovascular risk, alcoholism, smoking and silent ischaemic strokes; divorced twice and with five children. After his last separation 8 years ago he moved to his father's house. While his father was still alive his health situation was stable and monitored by professionals of the primary care team. He was recently referred to the Social Worker at the Health Centre due to his lack of personal hygiene and housing. The interdisciplinary work of the Social Worker and Community Nurse Case Manager resulted in a shared action plan. His father died a year ago and since then there was no news of the patient in the health centre and also he did not collect his medication from the pharmacy. The house was owned by inheritance by the smallest of the four brothers, who had threatened to expel him. In the interview, the brother claimed that he didn't want to be helped and only received visits from one of his sons occasionally to receive money. Primary care professionals visited him several times at home. The patient was cooperative and engaged when preparing a joint plan with the professionals involved. This joint plan allowed to activate the care coordination for a successful management of his chronic conditions.",0,1395
1001,"Scurvy is a very uncommon entity in pediatric population. Some case reports have been published in infants fed with boiled milk, in patients with iron overload secondary to hematological diseases and in children with food restrictions secondary to neurodevelopmental disorders. We report a case of a 4-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, which developed scurvy secondary to a long-term selective eating habit without fruit or vegetable intake. The objective of this case report is to announce the pediatrician and other professionals dedicated to primary health care about scurvy as a potential consequence of restrictive diets in children with autism spectrum disorders as well as the importance of dietary history in sick patients to prevent associated micronutrient deficiencies.",0,814
1002,"BACKGROUND: In the initial description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, many affected patients were adults with underlying medical comorbidities. Data on the clinical presentation and outcome of pediatric cases are lacking. We report the clinical presentation and outcome of MERS-CoV infection in 11 pediatric patients. METHODS: The clinical presentation, demographic and laboratory data of pediatric patients with MERS-CoV were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 11 pediatric cases that tested positive by screening and confirmatory polymerase chain reaction for MERS-CoV were reported from Saudi Arabia. Two patients were symptomatic and the other 9 cases were asymptomatic. The median age of patients was 13 (range 2-16) years. There were 8 females and 3 males (2.7:1 ratio). One symptomatic patient died and the other symptomatic patient recovered. The diagnosis of patients was based on positive nasopharyngeal swabs on 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV disease is not limited to adults. Most cases of childhood MERS-CoV infection were asymptomatic and tested positive during contact investigation of older patients. Severe disease can occur in children with underlying conditions.",1,1219

Its cause has been the subject of development of multiple theories and studies through the years. Currently various studies and experiments as its origin point mutation in the gene encoding SC9NA sodium channels, which have an important role in nociceptive transmission signals in the human body. The purpose of this study is to present two cases that were valued in the department of pediatric orthopedics at UMAE HTYOLV, patients whose insensitivity to pain has produced significant injuries that were once cause for valuation of the hospital.",0,684
1004,CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 42 year-old man with episodes of unilateral uveitis in his right eye. Ophthalmic examination showed a granulomatous anterior uveitis with vitritis. Systemic investigations revealed non-nephrotic proteinuria and microhaematuria. A renal biopsy showed IgA nephropathy. DISCUSSION: Uveitis and glomerulonephritis may have common immunological pathogenesis. IgA nephropathy should be a differential diagnosis in patients with uveitis and nephropathy.,0,486
1005,"Hepatic and biliary tract injuries due to traumatic causes are rare in pediatric patients. Of the total number of patients with closed abdominal trauma, less than 9 % have liver injury, and the frequency varies between 2 and 3 % of biliary tract lesions. Currently, the recommended treatment for closed abdominal trauma with liver injury without hemodynamic repercussion is conservative. In case of presenting intra or extrahepatic biliary tract lesion, the preferred approaches are minimally invasive, such as percutaneous or endoscopic surgery, using laparotomy in selected cases. We present the case of a patient with closed abdominal trauma and liver trauma, initially laparotomized on 2 occasions due to hemodynamic instability and hemoperitoneum; presented a subdiaphragmatic and coleperitoneal bilioma; it was performed minimally invasive percutaneous drainage under tomographic control.",0,894

1007,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital dislocation of the Radial head is a condition that has been described in a few cases in the international literature, the anterior and lateral dislocation were the less frequent forms of presentation with 15% of cases, each, and the posterior dislocation the most frequent with 70% of the total cases reported. However, this pathology is considered the most frequent congenital pathology of the elbow in children. The present study describes the case of a patient with congenital dislocation of elbow anterior variety and another case with dislocation lateral variety, both diagnosed at an early age, in which it has been decided for conservative management and an annual follow-up. A bibliographic review of the subject is also carried out. DISCUSSION: The congenital elbow dislocation usually has a benign evolution, being painless and not very limiting for the patient, so it can be managed conservatively. Pain and limited movement are indicative of surgical treatment. There are multiple surgical treatments for this entity, however they are not widely accepted due to the complications and poor results presented by them.",0,1152

It is a rare disease that usually occurs asymptomatically in 85% of cases and diagnosis is incidentally. We present the case of 57 years old woman with progressive pruritus and jaundice secondary to stenosis of the common hepatic duct and common bile by liver cyst, rare presentation which only has been documented in case reports: Deepak, et al., Wittig, et al. and Howard, et al.1-3.",0,515
1009,"A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was inserted into a 44-year-old man to provide parenteral nutrition in a protein-calorie malnutrition secondary to a benign pyloric stenosis. On the fifth day while monitoring the catheter, the patient presented with a massive whitish pleural effusion after undergoing gastric endoscopy in order to treat pyloric stenosis. Chylothorax was initially suspected, and the patient was admitted to a recovery unit. Indocyanine green was administered through the PICC, obtaining a greenish discoloration in the pleural effusion 30 min later. This led to the diagnosis of a pleural effusion caused by a vessel perforation due to the PICC, leading to parenteral nutrition extravasation. Thoraco-abdominal computed tomography was performed, which confirmed an innominate vein perforation due to the PICC. PICC insertion may be associated with severe complications, such as central vessel perforation, and therefore the correct position of a central catheter should be always checked. Intravenous computed tomography contrast is the gold standard for central vascular perforation diagnosis. However if a pleural effusion occurs in this context, it is possible to use a dye, which administered intravenously can lead us to the correct diagnosis in situ. Indocyanine green was used for this purpose in this case.",0,1347
1010,"Erector spinae plane block has been recently described and it appears as a very promising regional analgesia technique. We report the first continuous erector spinae plane block performed in a pediatric patient for thoracic surgery. A 15-month-old boy, diagnosed with a paracardiac teratoma was scheduled for a tumor resection with a thoracotomy approach. After general anesthesia induction, a continuous erector spinae plane block at T5 level was performed with ropivacaine 0.2%. After surgery, a continuous thoracic interfascial infusion of ropivacaine 0.1% along with multimodal rescue analgesia was initiated. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. It appears that this is a good alternative to thoracic epidural and paravertebral block, given the simple reproducibility and potential greater safety of this technique.",0,847

1012,"INTRODUCTION: Endocarditis is a rare disease in children, especially in those without previous heart disease, and Kingella Kingae (KK) is rarely identified as the cause. Extracorporeal membrane oxyge nation (ECMO) is a support for both heart and respiratory failure. OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to KK which required ECMO support secondary to refractory cardiogenic shock. CLINICAL CASE: 19-months-old previously healthy female patient, with a 2-day his tory of fever, and diagnosed with hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and deep hemodynamic compromise that required veno-arterial ECMO support. The echography showed an image compa tible with mitral valve vegetation, confirming IE with transthoracic echocardiography. Blood culture was positive for KK. She had an ischemic stroke and required two heart surgeries, the first one for the mass resection and the second one for mitral valve repair, which had a posterior ring pseudoa neurysm. The patient had a favorable evolution and was discharged 73 days after admission. At one year of follow-up, she had no cardiological symptoms, but a mild right brachial-crural hemiparesis persisted. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of IE due to KK that required extracorporeal life support. KK endocarditis is an uncommon pathology that can cause multiorgan failure, which can be successfully supported with ECMO.",0,1512
1013,"INTRODUCTION: Nail alterations in children are an important cause of parent anxiety and derive in multiple and unnecessary consultations. The onychomadesis corresponds to the complete and pain less detachment of the nail plate from the proximal fold. This self-resolving nail finding has been described as a late complication of hand-foot-mouth disease, a frequent viral exanthema in the pedia tric age. OBJECTIVE: To describe a classic pediatric case of hand-foot-mouth disease with subsequent onychomadesis. CLINICAL CASE: A 3-years-old male patient with an acute presentation of acute erythe matous perioral papulovesicles, which extend to upper extremities and hands, buttocks, thighs and feet, asymptomatic, and without compromising general condition. Skin lesions resolve completely, but after one month, he develops detachment of the nails, with subsequent complete recovery. Con clusions: The recognition of this association will allow primary care physicians to guide the parents about a benign and self-resolving process that may occur as part of the evolution of hand-foot-mouth disease, thus avoiding unnecessary anxiety, referral and treatments.",0,1158
1014,"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), or Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a rare disease characterized by disseminated necrotizing vasculitis with extravascular granulomas occurring among patients with asthma and tissue eosinophilia. Clinically, it presents in various ways and progresses in three phases: prodromic (asthma and rhino-sinusitis), eosinophilic (peripheral eosinophilia and organ involvement), and vasculitic (clinical manifestations due to small vessel vasculitis). The differential diagnosis of EGPA principally includes eosinophilic and vasculitic disorders, early treatment is needed to avoid a fatal outcome. We present the case report of a 38-year-old male with a history of asthma. After a month-and-a-half of progressive weakness, no fever, diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain associated with weight loss, he was diagnosed of intestinal parasitosis. He later died of a massive myocardial necrosis due to EGPA with multiple organs affected.",0,973

In patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism, the finding of thrombus in transit has been associated with high in-hospital mortality. We present a case of a 50-year-old male patient with acute pulmonary embolism and a thrombus in transit in the right atrium. We took the decision to perform fibrinolysis with tenecteplase, presenting significant improvement in the clinical condition, without any complications related to the therapy. Our case demonstrates the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy in cases of pulmonary embolism and thrombus in transit in right chambers.",0,637
1017,"Symptoms of hypopituitarism are usually chronic and nonspecific, but rarely the disease can have acute and life threatening manifestations. We report a 53 years old female with a pituitary adenoma that was admitted to our hospital because of syncope. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a prolonged QT interval. Frequent runs of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were noted on telemetry. The patient had a history of severe acute headaches in the previous days and laboratory tests revealed severe secondary hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and a decrease in pituitary hormones. A magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed changes in the size and contrast enhancement of the adenoma. A diagnosis of hypopituitarism secondary to pituitary apoplexy was made and treatment with hydrocortisone and, subsequently, levothyroxine was started. Hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism should be considered as unusual causes for reversible cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias.",0,1076
1018,"After the evacuation from Africa to Western hospitals of several international workers with the Ebola virus disease, the first case of contagion outside Africa occurred in Madrid, Spain. A nursing care assistant who had attended a missionary repatriated from Sierra Leone contracted the disease. On October 7(th) 2014, the patient arrived at the University Hospital La Paz-Carlos III in Madrid. She remained in the hospital for 30 days, 25 of which were in strict isolation in a negative pressure room with air lock anteroom; personal protective equipment was required. During the last five days, the patient was moved to a standard room. Protection measures were used in accordance with the Hospital Occupational Health Department. According to its evolution, we differentiate three phases with specific care demands which were conditioned by the risk of transmission, forcing extreme measures of prevention. The largest numbers of direct interventions fall within the realm of the nursing profession. It is essential that specialized units with regular training be created for highly contagious diseases. In addition, this and other cases should be analyzed from the point of view of nursing, to allow standardized care. We also recognize the importance of managing communication to prevent social unrest and stigmatization of staff.",0,1335

1020,"INTRODUCTION: Bevacizumab is a monoclonalantibody used as a targeted therapy in blocking vascularendothelial growth factor in different types of oncologicaland non-oncological diseases. It has demonstratedsurvival benefits in the treatment of many types of malignanttumors, including lung cancer. As all drugs have adverseeffects, one of the most uncommon being gastrointestinalperforation and few cases of ureteral stenosis. However,they do not mention or describe the perforation of segmentsof the urinary tract. OBJECTIVE: To describe renal pelvic perforation as an adverseeffect to the use of Bevacizumab. CASE DESCRIPTION: 67-year-old male patient with metastaticlung cancer being treated with Bevacizumab whohas perforation of the renal pelvis is presented. A pyelogramwas performed showing contrast extravasation at theleft renal pelvis and a double J catheter was placed, witha satisfactory clinical course, and tomographic control at 1month without evidence of extravasation of contrast, withdrawingdouble catheter J.

1021,"Chagas disease also known as American Trypanosomiasis is mainly caused by haematophagous insects widely distributed from Mexico to Argentina. According to the Panamerican Health Organization, 7.7 to 10 million people are living with chronic infection. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan transmitted by triatomine vectors. After an initial acute phase, Chagas is followed by a silent phase that lasts 15-20 years before debuting with cardiac, neurological or gastrointestinal manifestations. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the atypical clinical course of chagasic cardiopathy in a pediatric patient from southern Mexico. CASE REPORT: The patient was treated by a chagoma in his left leg. Five months later an electrocardiogram showed evidence of sinus tachycardia and left atrium distension with P wave enlargement and prolonged QT interval. The thorax radiography showed cardiomegaly (Cardio-thoracic index = 0.52); the trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed left atrial and ventricular dilation. CONCLUSION: It is important to develop early cardiac evaluations even in pediatric patients with Chagas disease, it should not be assumed that the patients will undergo a long asymptomatic phase or that they will not develop an early cardiopathy.",0,1256

The first US case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on 2 May 2014. METHODS: We summarize the clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, and MERS-CoV-specific tests. RESULTS: The patient is a 65-year-old physician who worked in a hospital in KSA where MERS-CoV patients were treated. His illness onset included malaise, myalgias, and low-grade fever. He flew to the United States on day of illness (DOI) 7. His first respiratory symptom, a dry cough, developed on DOI 10. On DOI 11, he presented to an Indiana hospital as dyspneic, hypoxic, and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography. On DOI 12, his serum tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for MERS-CoV and showed high MERS-CoV antibody titers, whereas his nasopharyngeal swab was rRT-PCR negative. Expectorated sputum was rRT-PCR positive the following day, with a high viral load (5.31 x 10(6) copies/mL). He was treated with antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was discharged on DOI 22. The genome sequence was similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV sequences, clustering with those from KSA from June to July 2013. CONCLUSIONS: This patient had a prolonged nonspecific prodromal illness before developing respiratory symptoms. Both sera and sputum were rRT-PCR positive when nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. US clinicians must be vigilant for MERS-CoV in patients with febrile and/or respiratory illness with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula, especially among healthcare workers.",1,1706
1023,"BACKGROUND: Splenic involvement secondary to blunt abdominal trauma is often treated by performing a splenectomy. The severity of the post-splenectomy syndrome is currently well known (blood loss, sepsis), so there is an increasing tendency to preserve the spleen. The case is presented of splenic preservation after blunt abdominal trauma with hilum involvement, emphasising the role of Floseal as a haemostatic agent, as well as the use of resorbable meshes to preserve the spleen. CLINICAL CASE: A 22-year-old woman presenting with a grade IV splenic lesion secondary to a blunt abdominal trauma after a traffic accident. Partial splenic resection was performed and bleeding was controlled with Floseal and use of a reinforcing polyglycolic acid mesh. No postoperative complications occurred, being discharged on day 5. The long-term follow-up has been uneventful. CONCLUSION: The use of haemostatic agents such as thrombin and the gelatine gel (FloSeal) and the use of polyglycolic acid meshes enable spleen-preserving surgery, making it a feasible and reproducible procedure and an alternative to classical splenectomy.",0,1124
1024,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has no curative treatment, and in moderate to advanced stages, functional parameters and quality of life are affected. Lung volume reduction improves respiratory parameters and quality of life of these patients. Endoscopic lung volume reduction is a minimally invasive procedure that uses endobronchial valves or coils. Valves are unidirectional, blocking the air from entering the target lobe during inspiration, allowing the exit of air and secretions during expiration. Complete fissure and absence of collateral ventilation are needed for an adequate functioning of endobronchial valves. Endobronchial coils cause mechanical retraction of the lung parenchyma. We report two patients who underwent endoscopic lung volume reduction by endobronchial valves. One patient was on continuous positive pressure non-invasive ventilation due to his severe emphysema.",0,905
1025,"A 54-year-old man with progressive prostate cancer underwent a (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT, which showed lymph node and bone metastases. After 2-cycles of (177)Lu-PSMA therapy, the repeated (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed decreased radiotracer uptake in lymph node and bones metastases, but there were new lesions which may be compatible with progression or tumour sink-effect. A review of (177)Lu-PSMA-therapy images revealed that new lesions in the second PET/CT were the metastatic lesions that progressed after the first PET/CT, and subsequently showed a good response. The patient received additional cycles of (177)Lu-PSMA therapy, and the disease regressed further, with a PSA of 0.06ng/ml. Response evaluation of new therapeutic diagnostics (theranostic) agents needs a review of not only diagnostic PET/CT images, but also post-therapy images and laboratory results.",0,860
1026,"Bartonella henselae infection is a frequent zoonosis from the domestic cat. It is presented with regional lymphadenitis in the majority of cases. Searching and characterization of lymph nodes by diagnostic imaging can be useful in the differential diagnosis approach, with a clear advantage, because it is a noninvasive method. Currently, new diagnostic imaging techniques improves the quality of screening and characterization of adenopathies, such is the case of PET/CT, which allows a better evaluation of hypermetabolic lymph nodes, without considering the individual growth of each lymph node. In this article, three cases of cat scratch diseases serology and their respective imaging findings are reviewed.",0,712
1027,"Radical cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy increases survival in patients with end-stage peritoneal carcinomatosis, and who are under palliative therapy. The Peritoneal Cancer Index enables the tumor burden to be quantified during surgery, as well as treatment planning and patient prognosis. It is obtained by combining the tumor spread in 13 abdominal and pelvic regions with the largest tumor size. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography is the technique of choice for those patients selected to undergo radical cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, due to its higher detection rate of carcinomatosis, and since it allows extra-peritoneal disease staging. The simplified Peritoneal Cancer Index (9 regions defined by 2 transverse and 2 sagittal planes) obtained by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography allows correlation with the surgical procedure, therefore its standardization is advisable.",0,1036
1028,"A 16-year-old boy had a past medical history of primary hypogonadism, due to bilateral anorchia. He presented with gallstones located in the gallbladder and a mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree. The histology study reported cholesterol gallstones. The patient had been treated with testosterone replacement therapy since infancy. We suggest a possible correlation between testosterone replacement therapy and the presence of cholesterol gallstones.",0,462
1029,"OBJECTIVE: Nested type transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is a rare histological variant among bladder tumors. Although clinical presentation is similar to the other bladder tumors, its macroscopic appearance may be equivocally benign, with submucosal growing which is difficult to detect on cystoscopy, so that diagnosis may be delayed. METHODS: We present the characteristics of nested type transitional cell carcinoma and review the differential diagnosis for this entity with possible counterfeiters. RESULTS: In this article, we report two cases of nested type transitional cell carcinoma that presents, in one of them, all three growing patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Microscopically nested transitional cell carcinoma is characterized by a cell distribution forming nests and tubules. They generally present low cytologic atypia simulating a low grade urothelial carcinoma, or benign bladder lesions such as von Brunn nests or nefrogenic adenoma.",0,953
1030,"A 10 year old girl with diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and fever of one month and a half of evolution. Analytical and sonographic findings raised the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopy and histology showed findings consistent with Crohn's disease. Treatment was initiated with mesalazine and exclusive enteral nutrition. Later corticosteroid treatment, immunosuppressive drugs and ursodeoxycholic acid were added due to cholestasis and persistent hypergammaglobulinemia. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The association between Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis is rare, predominantly in males between 20 and 40 years old and it presents a great clinical variability. The confirmation of the diagnosis requires magnetic resonance cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The prognosis is poor and there is no treatment to slow the progression of the disease.",0,1016
1031,"A 48 year-old immunocompetent woman, who had a nodular lesion in the neck and a dense infiltrate at the lower lobe of the left lung, presented at the Mycology Unit of Muniz Hospital of Buenos Aires City. The pulmonary infiltrate disappeared spontaneously 3 months later. The histopathological study of the nodular lesion showed capsulated yeasts (mucicarmin and alcian blue positive stains) compatible with Cryptococcus. The mycological study of a new sample, obtained by a nodular puncture, allowed the isolation of yeasts, identified as Cryptococcus gattii (VGII). Latex test for Cryptococcus capsular antigen in serum was positive (1/100). CSF cultures rendered negative results. Fluconazole at a daily dose of 800mg was given during 45 days with partial improvement; as cultures from a new clinical sample were positive for Cryptococcus, the antimycotic was changed to itraconazole 400mg/day for 5 months, with an excellent clinical response.",0,946

1033,"Thyroid cancer is an uncommon type of cancer, accounting less than 1% of all cancers in adults, and 0.5-3% of all cancers in children. There are four different types: papillary carcinoma (80-90% of cases), follicular (5-10%), medullary (5%) and anaplastic cell (2-3%). Eighty per cent of cases of medullary thyroid cancer are sporadic, but 20% are associated with an inherited syndrome that is divided into three groups: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. The inherited forms are caused by a disruption in the RET oncogene, which is located in the long arm of chromosome 10. A hereditary case of medullary thyroid carcinoma is presented. It was detected because of a familial genetic study. The purpose of the paper is emphasize the importance of the early diagnosis and the intervention of multidisciplinary teams of experts.",0,906
1034,"We describe a case of fat droplets and blood in the cerebral subarachnoid space secondary in a patient with a complex sacral fracture without associated cranial trauma, a few days after admission. To our knowledge, there is only one published case with similar findings and without any other underlying lesion as cause. We explain the differences in the mechanism of production between this direct fat embolism and brain fat embolism syndrome, which is an intravascular embolism with different radiological appearance. The most important features of sacral fracture with spondylopelvic dissociation are described. Finally, this entity should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of the few causes of fat in the subarachnoid space. In the context of high-energy trauma fractures of the sacrum or spine must be ruled out as a potential cause of this uncommon intracranial finding.",0,893
1035,"INTRODUCTION: Central nervous system tuberculosis is a common chronic infection in developing countries, being the most frequent forms: tuberculous meningitis and intracranial tuberculosis. Extramedullary intradural tuberculosis is a rare entity with few cases described in the world literature, and is usually associated with a history of tuberculous meningitis or during antituberculosis treatment. CASE REPORT: A 17 years-old male patient, without history of tuberculosis, with subacute onset and progressive course of compressive myelopathy. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary mass lesion between the C4 and T8 spinal levels. Surgical resection of tuberculoma was realized, followed by chemotherapy. The histopathological study confirmed the diagnostic. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis of the central nervous system is an entity of high incidence in developing countries, and intradural extramedullary tuberculoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of expansive spinal cord injuries, especially if the patient is young and there is a history of pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculous meningitis. It is also important to take it into account as part of a paradoxical reaction after the initiation of specific treatment. Although surgical resection improves compressive medullary symptoms, medical therapy remains the mainstay in the treatment of tuberculomas.",0,1406

Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with Fluor18 deoxyglucose (F18-FDG) is a useful tool in the staging of gallbladder cancer. We report a 68 years old man with a surgically resected acute cholecystitis, whose biopsy was positive for signet ring cell gallbladder carcinoma. During surgery, locoregional lymph nodes, liver or peritoneal involvement were not detected. A PET/CT was performed for staging, finding multiple hypermetabolic lytic bone lesions. Percutaneous biopsy of a pelvis bone lesion, confirmed a metastasis of the tumor. In this case, the staging with PET/CT allowed the diagnosis of unsuspected bone metastases and was a useful tool for deciding the best site of biopsy for histologic confirmation.",0,848

1039,"BACKGROUND: Hypercalcaemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis, with a reported prevalence of 1.5 to 8%. There is no clear pathophysiological basis, but elevated parathyroid hormone and high serum calcium levels could be responsible for calcium deposit in the pancreatic ducts and activation of pancreatic enzymes, which may be the main risk factor for developing acute pancreatitis. The aim of this report is to describe four cases. CLINICAL CASE: Four cases are reported of severe pancreatitis associated with hypercalcaemia secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism; three of them with complications (two pseudocysts and one pancreatic necrosis). Cervical ultrasound, computed tomography, and scintigraphy using 99mTc-Sestambi, studies showed the parathyroid adenoma. Surgical resection was the definitive treatment in all four cases. None of the patients had recurrent acute pancreatitis events during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis secondary to hypercalcaemia of primary hyperparathyroidism is rare; however, when it occurs it is associated with severe pancreatitis. It is suspected in patients with elevated serum calcium and high parathyroid hormone levels. Imaging techniques such as cervical ultrasound, computed tomography, and scintigraphy using 99mTc-Sestambi, should be performed, to confirm clinical suspicion. Surgical resection is the definitive treatment with excellent results.",0,1443

A fracture occurred in the prosthetic neck and the other two at the juncture of the conical and cylindrical stem portion, coinciding with the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction of the femur. The main causes of the failure were an increasing concentration of forces at the level of the implant as a consequence of the increased length of the neck and lateralization of the femur (offset). Other causes that have contributed to this prosthetic failure are analyzed.",0,620
1041,"INTRODUCTION: Subglottic stenosis (SGS) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) may result from active disease or from chronic recurrent inflammation. The objective of the study was to describe the clinical features and treatment of patients with subglottic stenosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with SGS due to GPA diagnosed at Rheumatology deparment between January 2000 and June 2015. RESULTS: We present 4 cases of SGS at our department during a period of 15 years. The interval between the presentation of the GPA and SGS varied between 2 and 144 months. The leading symptoms of SGS were dyspnoea on exertion and stridor. Three patients presented SGS without evidence of systemic activity. Two patients presented SGS grade i and received tracheal dilatation; two recurred and three needed a tracheostomy due to severe airway-limiting stenosis. CONCLUSION: SGS presents high morbidity. Even though subglottic dilatation provides symptomatic relief, recurrences may present. Severe airway-limiting stenosis often requires tracheostomy.",0,1085

1045,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case of a well-differentiated primary intradural-extramedullary neuroendocrine tumor of the filum terminale and to conduct a literature review. CASE: A 68-years old patient was assessed after presenting lower back pain and sciatica with ineffective pain relief. The patient presented an intradural-extramedullary lumbar lesion arising from the filum terminale, which was partially resected. The pathology diagnosis was a well-differentiated primary neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor). After a multidisciplinary evaluation, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was administered. No progression or metastatic spread was observed in successive assessments. DISCUSSION: Neuroendocrine tumors are heterogeneous neoplasms derived predominantly from enterochromaffin cells, in which chemotherapy plays a very limited role. In contrast, radiotherapy has been described in partially resected lesions. CONCLUSION: Well-differentiated primary neuroendocrine tumors with intradural-extramedullary lumbosacral location are an exceptional rarity. Isolated surgical resection, or associated with an adjuvant radiotherapy treatment in subtotal resections, could be considered an effective therapeutic strategy.",0,1224
1046,"The development of person-centered clinical care is inscribed within an international programmatic movement towards a medicine focused on the totality of the person. This movement, with broad historical bases, has been maturing since 2008 through conferences among global health institutions, research projects and academic publications. This paper is aimed at elucidating the conceptual principles of person-centered medicine (PCM) and to delineate strategies for the practical application of such principles in clinical care services. The above objectives have been approached through literature reviews, international consultations, and reflections on the patterns and indications obtained. The principles identified for person-centered medicine are the following: Ethical commitment, holistic framework, cultural awareness and responsiveness, communication and relational focus, individualized clinical care, common ground among clinicians, patient and family for joint diagnostic understanding and shared decision making, person- and community-centered organization of integrated services, and person-centered medical education and research. Additionally, pertinent strategies have been delineated for the implementation of such principles in clinical care. The authors conclude that the presented principles and strategies are consistent with suggestions offered in the literature and may serve as bases for the design of indices and scales. Their continuous refinement is proposed through future international and local studies. to clarify the key concepts of the movement as well as strategies for their practical clinical application.",0,1643

1048,"The article presents the diagnosis of the living conditions of male and female adolescents in the area of the valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (in Spanish: VRAEM), who are exposed to situations of risk and social and sexual vulnerability and sexual due to the high levels of coca-leaf production and the context of the illegal drug trade which create the illusion of rapid social ascent. From this, it is necessary to ask: what are the living conditions and risk situations of adolescents in the VRAEM? And, what are the alternatives for an improvement of their situation from access to education and health care programs? This risk situation is the result of unequal gender relations, sexual violence, school dropout, teen pregnancy, alcohol and drug use, as well as of the lack of opportunities as a result of the participation in coca economy and illegal drug trade among adolescents in the VRAEM. Finally, we present the results of the attention of professionals of the health centers to promote counseling on sexual and reproductive health and access to health services of the Adolescent Life Program Life, as an opportunity to link the contents of the education curriculum and the compliance targets of this sector, highlighting the need of an approach of multiculturalism and gender equality in the access to health and education of adolescents.",0,1366
1049,"INTRODUCTION: Growing skull fracture, also known as post-traumatic bone absorption or leptomeningeal cyst, is a rare complication of traumatic brain injuries and occurs almost exclusively in children under 3 years of age. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 6-month-old child who presented, two months after an apparently unimportant traumatic skull injury, persistence of left temporoparietooccipital cephalohaematoma with no other signs. A transfontanellar ultrasonography scan revealed a bone defect with brain herniation, and computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging also confirmed the existence of a growing fracture. Excision of the leptomeningeal cyst, dural closure and repair of the bone defect with plates and lactate material were performed. Three months after the operation, the patient still presented collection of fluid and recurrence of the growing fracture was confirmed. Following the second operation, a baby helmet was fitted in order to prevent renewed recurrences. One year after the traumatic injury occurred, the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Any child under 3 years of age with a post-traumatic cephalohaematoma should be checked periodically until the full resolution of the collection of fluid, especially if they present a fractured skull. The presence of a cephalohaematoma that remains more than two weeks after traumatic brain injury must make us suspect a growing fracture and reparation of the dura mater and a cranioplasty will be needed to treat it. The use of resorbable material allows it to be remodelled as the patient's skull grows, but its fragility increases the risk of recurrence. The use of a baby helmet after the operation could prevent complications.",0,1726

1051,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years there has been an increase in the number of endovascular examinations in the study of both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. One very infrequent complication is neurotoxicity due to contrast, and it must be suspected within the context of a neurological deficit following such examinations in order to be able to diagnose it. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old male who presented an epileptic attack and later deficit in the left hemisphere following diagnostic arteriography. After ruling out the possibility of an urgent vascular pathology, he was submitted to a magnetic resonance brain scan with the suspicion of this condition. The clinical signs and symptoms were limited to 72 hours with cortisone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-induced encephalopathy covers a wide range of clinical features which, in the vast majority of cases, are self-limiting to 24-72 hours, and within the context of neuronal damage following contrast infusion. Its prognosis is excellent, and diagnostic suspicion is crucial in its treatment.",0,1057
1052,"Family physicians frequently encounter patients with neck mass. There are multiple causes that range from no clinical importance to malignant tumours. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. With a good knowledge of the complex anatomy of the neck and a careful clinical history, including a complete physical examination, the different causes can be narrowed down, as well as to differentiate between significant and non-significant neck masses and select the appropriate studies.

1053,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common complications in transplant patients, which can lead to multiple organ failure. The 80-90% of patients are cured with intravenous treatment standard (ganciclovir), or its oral prodrug (valganciclovir). In case there is no answer, we have alternatively another antiviral, foscarnet. A small number of patients do not respond to this, having a bad prognosis. The aim is to describe the case of a double lung transplant for cystic fibrosis, and recurrent CMV infection in which the use of leflunomide gets lower and even reach undetectable viral load. DESCRIPTION OF CASE: woman, 22 year old, double lung transplant for cystic fibrosis in March 2014. The CMV serology performed was positive in the donor and negative in the recipient. Controls viral load during prophylaxis with valganciclovir were negative in the receiver until the 6th month after transplantation, at which viral load was detected in controls (2 090 IU/ml). The patient was admitted to our hospital to receive intravenous treatment with ganciclovir, after one month with intravenous therapy viral load persisted positive (42 400 IU/ml). One study of resistance showed that was resistant to ganciclovir, so began treatment with intravenous foscarnet. This drug achieved negativizar viral load, so the treatment was discontinued, continuing with fortnightly controls viral load. After two months without treatment, viral load increased to 13 665 IU/ml, why was requested to Pharmacy Service the off-label use of leflunomide, with the intention that use oral therapy, instead of intravenous therapy. The patient was treated with valganciclovir until have the authorization of use of leflunomide, although unanswered, since in March 2015, at the start of leflunomide treatment the patient had a viral load of 17 344 IU/ml. The initial regimen was 100 mg of leflunomide daily for the first five days, followed by 20 mg every 12 hours. After fifteen days of treatment viral load had fallen to 531 IU/ml, becoming undetectable in one month. After four months of treatment the patient remains with undetectable viral load without having any adverse effect associated with it. CONCLUSION: our case is an example where the use of leflunomide in CMV infection resistant to other therapies is an effective and convenient alternative for patients because it keeps undetectable viral load with an oral therapy without having to enter the hospital for intravenous treatment.",0,2509

1055,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare vascular malignancy that accounts for 2% of all hepatic primary tumours. The diagnosis is difficult, especially if the patient does not have history of exposure to carcinogens, which are considered as risk factors. The diagnosis is made by histopathology, but in a considerable percentage it can only be accomplished by autopsy. The performing of fine needle aspiration biopsy can lead to bleeding, with limitations in its use. CLINICAL CASE: A 41 year-old male, with no history of exposure to carcinogens, who developed abdominal pain secondary to a haemoperitoneum due to tumour rupture, was diagnosed by imaging methods with a giant cavernous hepatic haemangioma. He was initially treated with embolisation, and later with a liver transplant. After six months he developed haemoptysis secondary to lung metastasis. The autopsy reported metastatic hepatic angiosarcoma. DISCUSSION: This condition has been related to carcinogen exposure, with malignant transformation from a benign vascular neoplasia being proposed as a hypothesis. The differential diagnosis can be achieved with imaging studies such as CT scan, and the definitive diagnosis is made by histopathology with immunohistochemistry tests, with 35%-100% being made in the autopsy. CONCLUSION: Hepatic angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular neoplasia, the potential curative option is surgery with tumour free margins. Liver transplantation remains controversial because of its poor prognosis in the short term.",0,1515

CLINICAL CASE: A 37 year old male was referred by his GP to the General Surgery Department with axillary hidradenitis which had evolved over the years. The physical examination shows signs of hidradenitis in both axillae, with a noticeable suppurative hidradenitis in the right armpit. En bloc extirpation was performed to remove the whole affected area. The pathological examination revealed a cutaneous leishmaniasis. Subsequently, fucidin was administered topically, as well as local infiltrations of one millilitre of Glucantime. DISCUSSION: Hidradenitis normally appears in intertriginous areas and its manifestation is accompanied by recurrent subcutaneous nodules. The incidence rate in females is three times higher than in males. The isolated Hidradenitis caused by Leishmania is a rare condition presented only in endemic areas or in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-infected patients. Clinical manifestations can be different and the diagnosis can be confirmed through haematoxylin-eosin. The main pattern displays a disorganised granuloma without necrosis. Systemic or topical treatment can be applied. Immunotherapy treatment is the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Hidradenitis caused by Leishmania in HIV-negative patients is a rare condition. Therefore it is important to perform a good histological diagnosis and to administer the right treatment.",0,1554
1059,"Infections caused by rare micro-organisms are the subject of research, as researchers are encouraged to find the necessary health measures to prevent and treat the disease, as well as the search for new insights into human-microbial interactions. This report describes the case of a newborn boy diagnosed with hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele who developed ventriculitis and sepsis from resistant Empedobacter brevis. This case highlights the unexpected identification of this bacterium in the cerebrospinal fluid and its multi-resistant pattern, which was crucial for proper therapeutic management. This bacterium shows a mixture of different etiologies in the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.",0,696
1060,"Stress cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo syndrome, is similar to that of an acute coronary syndrome, with electrocardiographic changes and an increase in troponin levels; however, coronary arteriography typically shows no obstructive lesions. One of the characteristic patterns are regional wall motion abnormalities identified by echocardiography. It has been described in association with thyroid disorders, although the causal mechanism is not clearly established. We present the case of a woman with acute chest pain and electrical and analytical changes. A severe ventricular dysfunction was observed but the coronary tree was free of lesions, all of which was compatible with a stress cardiomyopathy. Hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease was observed as a trigger. The identification and management of clinical factors that might predispose patients to Takotsubo syndrome or impact on subsequent clinical outcome is mandatory.",0,929
1061,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) accounts for nearly 1% of all gastrointestinal tumors. Its association with renal transplantation is not frequent. Approximately 95% of GIST show staining for CD177. DOG1 is a recently described monoclonal antibody that shows positivity even in the absence of CD177 staining. The diagnosis of GIST should be pursued because of the availability of very effective treatments with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. Herein, we describe the case of a woman with renal transplant who presented a small bowel GIST and weak positivity for CD177, treated initially with surgery. Tumor recurrence was documented 3 years later and histopatology showed loss of CD177 staining and positivity for DOG1. She was treated with imatimib without further recurrence after five years of follow up.",0,808
1062,Postsurgical aspergillosis occurs primarily in immunocompetent patients whose main predisposing factor is the loss of skin and mucosal integrity during surgery. Local infection tends to be destructive and refractory to treatment and relapses are common. It is important to consider aspergillosis in the differential diagnosis of slowly progressive and destructive surgical site infections with negative bacterial cultures. We present the case of a child who developed Aspergillus fumigatus mediastinitis months after heart surgery.,0,531
1063,"The process that follows an acute myocardial infarction generates an appropriate substrate for the formation of reentry circuits, considered to be the most frequent mechanism of ventricular extrasystoles and tachyarrhythmias. We present the case of a patient with an acute myocardial infarction unusually concurring with ventricular trigeminy coupled to ventricular bigeminated extrasystoles giving rise to a trigeminy sequence over the bigeminy, which indicates the existence of two reentry circuits (reentry of reentry) that trigger ventricular flutter.",0,555
1064,"INTRODUCTION: Fahr syndrome (SF) is a rare neurological disorder, characterized by abnormal deposition of calcium in brain areas that control movement. OBJECTIVE: The case is presented of a 41-year-old female with a convulsive syndrome, psychotic disorder, neurocognitive disorde,r and intellectual disability associated with bilateral brain calcifications and altered calcium/phosphorus metabolism in the context of hypoparathyroidism. METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: The calcifications found in the patient could be the cause of psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Diagnostic imaging, laboratory tests, psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments are presented. The clinical presentation of this case is compared with similar ones reported in the literature. Therapeutic approaches and clinical outcomes are described. CONCLUSIONS: Fahr's syndrome should be suspected in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and seizures. Neuroimaging studies, and the determining of phosphorus and calcium metabolism and parathyroid hormone levels are important in this type of patient.",0,1086
1065,"CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old man presented with a unilateral left ptosis of two years onset. After ineffective treatment for vernal conjunctivitis for several months, the biopsy demonstrated tarsal amyloidosis. Surgical resolution of the case was anatomically and functionally satisfactory. DISCUSSION: Ocular amyloidosis is a rare disease that must be suspected with infiltrative mass lesions. Biopsy is the diagnostic method. Treatment should be individualised.",0,461
1066,"The transpsoas approach, also known as extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF), to the lumbar spine is a novel minimally invasive technique with positive clinical outcomes and a low complication rate. There is a low risk of bleeding, due to this approach causing less soft tissue disruption than traditional spine surgery, but segmental arteries and great vessels can be damaged. Retroperitoneal haematoma is a major complication, with few cases reported. This is the first case reported in a Stand-alone XLIF and also the first case reported with haemorrhagic shock. Non-specific symptoms such tachycardia, hypotension, and anaemia are the most prevalent in this complication. With this case, our aim is to describe serious complications related to XLIF.",0,755
1067,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal wall Actinomycosis is a rare disease associated with the use of intrauterine device and as a complication of abdominal surgery. Diagnosis is difficult because it is unusual and behaves like a malignant neoplasm. AIM: A case report is presented of a patient who had used an intrauterine device for four years and developed a stony tumour in the abdominal wall associated with a set of symptoms that, clinically and radiologically, was simulating a peritoneal carcinomatosis associated with paraneoplastic syndrome, even in the course of an exploratory laparotomy. CLINICAL CASE: The patient attended our hospital with a two-month history of abdominal pain and symptoms that mimic a paraneoplastic syndrome. The diagnosis of abdominal actinomycosis was suspected by the finding of the microorganism in cervical cytology together with other cultures and Actinomyces negative in pathological studies, confirming the suspicion of a complete cure with empirical treatment with penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomycosis should be considered in patients with pelvic mass or abdominal wall mass that mimics a malignancy. Antibiotic therapy is the first treatment choice and makes a more invasive surgical management unnecessary.",0,1238
1068,"Tibial spine avulsion fractures (also called tibial eminence fractures) are bony avulsions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) from its insertion in the intercondylar eminence. It is most commonly seen in children aged eight to 12 years, because LCA is more resistent than bone and physis. Furthermore, the union between epiphisys and LCA is very strong due to the collagen fibers. Meyers and McKeever classification defines three types: type I: non displaced; type II: partially dislaced; and type III: completely displaced. This classification is very important for the treatment. Arthroscopic treatment is the gold standard for displaced fractures. The association with other intraarticular injuries is frequent, and the anterior horn of the medial meniscus or the transverse meniscal ligament is frequently trapped within the fracture site. A miniarthrotomy may still be necessary in fractures that are irreducible by arthroscopic means. Its difficult to find chronic fractures in children in the literature. The treatment is similar to acute cases, but includes debridement of the scar tissue and reparation of intraarticular injuries. Loss of extension is the main problem we find in this patients, although acceptable results may be achieved. In this article we present a seven years old boy with a chronic tibial spine avulsion, the treatment and the outcome.",0,1371
1069,"We have recently documented a case of tropical spastic paraparesis by HTLV-I in a Spanish patient. HTLV-I infection is rare in Europe, and hardly ever is accompanied by symptoms, but if it does it could trigger a major health issue. This case is presented here, as well as a discussion on the situations in which HTLV-I detection is justified. An analysis was made of the HTLV diagnostic requests at our centre during 2014-2015 (n=123). The diagnostic algorithm was: 1) Enzyme immunoassay, 2) Reverse hybridization, and 3) Proviral DNA detection by PCR. The results showed several situations of HTLV screening, emphasising those related to paraparesis (22%). Seven cases of HTLV-I infection were found: five in patients from endemic regions, one in an HIV-infected patient, and the case of TSP mentioned above. HTLV-I surveillance in non-endemic regions is a challenging issue, as the cost-benefit ratio is not well-established. This case report emphasises the importance of including HTLV within the differential diagnosis of insidious spastic paraparesis.",0,1057
1070,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented on a patient with primary open-angle glaucoma treated with the novel ultrasound circular cyclocoagulation technique (UC3((R)) [EyeTechCare, Rillieux La Pape, France]), who had previously undergone glaucoma surgery. Due to having extreme palpebral rigidity, worsened by the pre-operative local anesthesia injections, a canthotomy and cantholysis were needed to correctly position of the UC3((R)) probe cone. Clinical outcome as regards the IOP and the surgical wound was very satisfactory. DISCUSSION: In complex cases of refractory glaucoma in which cyclo-destructive surgery is limited for anatomical reasons, a complementary oculoplasty technique may be a good option.",0,705
1071,"INTRODUCTION: Klippel-Feil syndrome is a highly heterogeneous complex skeletal disorder characterized by the con genital fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. The classic clinical triad consists of a short neck, low hairline, and neck movements limitation. The associated mutations are located in the loci of the GDF3 gene (chromosome 12p13.31), GDF6 (chromosome 8q22.1), and MEOX1 (chromosome 17q21.31). OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical-radiological findings and pedigree of a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome. CLINICAL CASE: A 5-year-old patient with short neck, low posterior hairline, and limitation of lateral movements. The cervical flexion and extension radiographs showed fusion blocks between C1-2-3, C4-5, and C6-7. The chest CT scan showed multiple hemivertebrae in the upper third of the thoracic vertebrae corresponding to ribs I-IV. The karyotype was normal, 46, XX. Reduced penetrance was present in five of the family members. The fusion of C2-3 was present in four members and one individual had low fusion in C5-6. Three of the five affected individuals had a fusion between the capitate and the hamate bone. CONCLUSION: The malformation of congenital vertebral segmentation is a case of interest since it is an uncommon diagnosis in the pediatric age and whose clinical suspicion can be generated from the clinical examination, radiological study com plemented with the pedigree interpretation in Mendelian inheritance disorders, allowing to provide opportunely genetic counseling to the family.",0,1523
1072,"Darier disease is an autosomal-dominant inherited condition caused by mutation of a gene, which produces a protein involved in calcium channel regulation. The disease has a variety of manifestations and lacks consistent genotype-phenotype correlations. Acral hemorrhagic Darier disease causes macules, papules, vesicles and/or hemorrhagic blisters on the extremities. Other classic signs of the disease may be present in the same patient or relatives. Histopathology reveals dyskeratosis and suprabasal acantholysis with hemorrhagic lacunae. We report 3 new cases of this type of Darier disease triggered by injuries. Response to retinoid therapy was good.",0,656
1073,"Mumps virus usually produces a benign infection characterized by increased parotid volume which, prior to vaccination, mainly affected children and adolescents. After the introduction of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, mumps incidence decreased dramatically. This intervention also produced a change in its clinical presentation, moving to young adult patients, with an increased risk of complications. We report two clinical mumps cases in young adults with different clinical presentations. In both cases, serologic assays were assessed and, in one case, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in order to confirm the diagnosis. The isolated virus was characterized and identifed as G genotype, the same genotype observed during outbreaks in United States and Europe, and different to the vaccinal strain. Mumps virus is currently circulating in Chile and it is important to be aware of possible outbreaks. Viral diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in populations with high vaccination coverage. Therefore, the access to etiologic study through PCR and serology becomes more relevant in order to optimize clinical management and secondary prevention measures.",0,1185
1074,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic adenomas are uncommon epithelial tumours. They usually appear in women between 20 and 44 years old. They are commonly located in the right hepatic lobe and are typically solitary masses. Multiple adenomas can present in patients with prolonged use of oral contraceptive pills, glycogen storage diseases and hepatic adenomatosis. CLINICAL CASE: A 35 year-old woman without any significant past medical history, with a chief complaint that started in December 2012 with oppressive, mild intensity abdominal pain located in right upper quadrant in the abdomen on deep palpation. With an abdominal ultrasound showing a mass of 91x82x65cm located in the right flank, isoechogenic with internal vascularity. Contrast computed tomography scan showing an ovoid tumour with circumscribed borders, with heterogenic intense reinforcement and displacement of adjacent structures with dimensions of 88x71x80cm. In laparotomy, excision of the tumour and cholecystectomy with the trans surgical findings of an 8cm tumour with a pedicle containing one artery and one vein coming from the hepatic free border with strong adhesions to the gallbladder. Pathologic diagnosis: Extracapsular hepatic adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of hepatic adenomas has increased in the last decades, in a parallel fashion with the introduction of oral contraceptive pills, showing association with glycogen storage diseases and to a lesser degree with diabetes and pregnancy. Diagnosis is clinical with the aid of imaging studies. Prognosis of hepatic adenomas is not well established, therefore, management depends on symptoms, size, number, location and certainty of diagnosis.",0,1664
1075,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of rhabdomyolysis associated with the use of quetiapine and lamotrigine in an adolescent treated for bipolar disorder. METHOD: Description of the clinical case, analysis of the associated factors and a non-systematic review of the relevant literature. RESULTS: An 18 year old male, with bipolar disorder and treated pharmacologically with quetiapine and lamotrigine, after two weeks of physical activity presents with rhabdomyolysis. Quetiapine and exercise have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The mediator mechanism of this association has not been found, although it has been established that there is neuromuscular dysfunction and an increase in sarcomere permeability. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case allowed the complex interaction between antipsychotic agents and increased physical activity to be observed in a psychiatric adolescent patient, as well as the appearance of a potentially lethal medical complication.",0,957
1076,"UNLABELLED: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is caused by Bartonella henselae, with unknown prevalence and incidence in the Chilean paediatric population. Regional lymphadenopathy is the most common presentation, while atypical forms constitute a diagnostic challenge. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of CSD with osteomyelitis and present guidelines regarding treatment. CLINICAL CASE: An eight year-old patient, with prolonged febrile illness, back pain and neck stiffness. Laboratory studies highlight positive IgG for Bartonella henselae. The abdominal ultrasound showed splenic micro-abscesses, and the MRI showing vertebral lesions suggestive of osteomyelitis. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of atypical forms requires a high rate of suspicion, as in this case, in which the patient manifested the musculoskeletal symptoms simultaneously with the febrile syndrome, which led us to study possible complications of the disease. Current knowledge of the treatment of atypical or complicated CSD is derived from the observation of case studies, rather than randomized trials. It is suggested that antibiotic therapy is analysed individually, with the help of a specialist. CONCLUSION: The importance of high clinical suspicion are emphasised and discussed, as well presenting some treatment options based on the evidence from the current literature.",0,1334
1077,"The late development of symmetrical, ascending telangiectasias over an extensive area of the skin with no associated systemic manifestations is a common presentation of generalized essential telangiectasia (GET). It was recently suggested that cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is clinically identical to GET but that the 2 conditions can be distinguished by their distinctive histopathologic findings. We present 2 patients, both women, with multiple telangiectasias and describe the histopathologic findings that led to the diagnoses of GET and CCV. Dermoscopic findings in both cases were similar, except that the older telangiectasias in the patient with CCV were violaceous and distributed in a tortuous, serpentine pattern. During follow-up 12 years for the woman with GET and 42 years for the woman with CCV we saw that in GET the lesions remained stable in appearance whereas in CCV there was progressive darkening and morphological changes eventually resulting in superficial varicose veins.",0,1007
1078,"INTRODUCTION: Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is a disease related to amyloid material deposits in the extracellular matrix that can affect many tissues, including the eye. CASE REPORT: This case includes clinical data, a full corneal study report, and histopathological findings, as well as the treatment and follow up of bilateral neurotrophic keratopathy in a 33 year-old patient with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. DISCUSSION: Although amyloidotic deposits were also found in the conjunctival tissue, this is not a typical form of ophthalmic amyloidosis. The corneal wound in this case is a result of a corneal anaesthesia due to the systemic polyneuropathy.",0,672
1079,"BACKGROUND: Desmoid tumours are one of the rarest tumours worldwide, with an estimated yearly incidence of 2-4 new cases per million people. They are soft tissue monoclonal neoplasms that originate from mesenchymal stem cells. It seems that the hormonal and immunological changes occurring during pregnancy may play a role in the severity and course of the disease. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented on 28-year-old female in her fifth week of gestation, in whom an abdominal wall tumour was found attached to left adnexa and uterus while performing a prenatal ultrasound. The patient was followed up under clinical and ultrasonographic surveillance. When she presented with abnormal uterine activity at 38.2 weeks of gestation, she was admitted and obstetrics decided to perform a caesarean section. Tumour biopsy was taken during the procedure. Histopathology reported a desmoid fibromatosis. A contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan was performed, showing a tumour of 26x20.5x18cm, with well-defined borders in contact with the uterus, left adnexa, bladder and abdominal wall, with no evidence of infiltration to adjacent structures. A laparotomy, with tumour resection, hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy, components separation techniques, polypropylene mesh insertion, and drainage was performed. The final histopathology report was desmoid fibromatosis. There is no evidence of recurrence after 6 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumours are locally aggressive and surgical resection with clear margins is the basis for the treatment of this disease, using radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy as an adjunct in the treatment.",0,1672
1080,"The deletion of chromosomal region 1p36 is one of the most common sub-telomeric microdeletion syndromes and has distinctive dysmorphic features. On the other hand, partial trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 6 is a rare chromosomal abnormality with a variable phenotype. OBJECTIVE: To report a case with both chromosome abnormalities, and to highlight the importance of the karyotype as a diagnostic tool in dysmorphology. CLINICAL CASE: The case of is presented of a two month-old infant with several craniofacial anomalies, neck haemangioma, sacral pit, rhizomelic shortening, small hands and feet, left unilateral cryptorchidism, and hypotonia. The infant also suffered intrauterine growth restriction and is the product of the eighth pregnancy of a 28 years old woman. Due to the unspecific findings in phenotype, a karyotype was requested, which showed a partial deletion of 1p36.1 and a partial trisomy of chromosome 6. CONCLUSION: The development of new techniques in molecular biology has improved diagnostic possibilities in medical genetics. However, the traditional karyotype remains as an important diagnostic tool in patients with multiple congenital anomalies.",0,1177
1081,"INTRODUCTION: Achalasia is the most common primary motor disorder of the esophagus. Its reported incidence is low, even more in pediatric patients. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the current stan dard of treatment. During the last years, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been positioned as a safe and effective therapeutic alternative as the Heller procedure for esophageal achalasia. Ob jective: To describe the POEM technique and report the first pediatric case in our country. CLINICAL CASE: 11-year-old patient, previously healthy, who presented with progressive dysphagia for solids and liquids and weight loss. The study concluded a type II achalasia. The patient underwent a POEM and had a postoperative course without incidents. One year after the intervention, symptomatic, endoscopic and manometric resolution have been documented. CONCLUSIONS: The described case is the first POEM in a pediatric patient in our country. Esophageal achalasia is uncommon in pediatrics and POEM has demonstrated clinical success and safety comparable to laparoscopic Heller myotomy in short and medium term. Long-term follow-up will determine its definitive role in the treatment of pediatric patients with esophageal achalasia.",0,1226
1082,"We present a case of severe acute pancreatitis induced by hypertriglyceridemia secondary to lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency in a pregnant patient with gestational diabetes, initially maneged with diet but it was later necessary to carry out artificial nutricional support measures: total parenteral nutrition. LPL deficiency might cause severe hypertriglyceridemia, repetition acute pancreatitis which is an unwieldy and severe situation during pregnancy. Acute familial hypertriglyceridemia pancreatitis accounts for 5% of cases, including LPL deficiency. The goal of treatment is to reach triglycerides levels below 500 mg/dl, being very low fat diet the treatment of choice, drugs or plasmapheresis techniques can also be associated. TPN enriched in omega3 fatty acids and glutamine was safe and effective in our patient with significant decrease in triglyceride levels.",0,877
1083,"INTRODUCTION: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are two serious immune diseases within the context of bullous mucocutaneous syndrome. These have varying degrees of involvement of the skin and usually at least two mucous membranes. CLINICAL CASES: Three clinical cases are presented, two of them with significant ophthalmological sequelae, who had received drug treatment as a possible trigger, and another milder clinical case caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. DISCUSSION: The ophthalmologist plays a crucial role in the outcome and eye care of the patient in order to try to avoid the appearance of sequelae and subsequent loss of vision.",0,660
1084,"Detection of virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in HIV-infected patients with HIV viral load (VL) undetectable in plasma has been termed viral escape. These leaks may be asymptomatic from a neurological point of view, similar to plasma blips, or associated with neurological disease, with discordant VL between plasma and CSF, and may be evidence of a compartmentalization of the virus and the possibility of identifying quasispecies with mutations that confer resistance to ART. We present the case of a man with AIDS and disseminated tuberculosis who presented neurological symptomatology evidenced by headache and convulsive syndrome, who presented a discordance between plasma and CSF HIV VL; the genotypic test of the virus, obtained by lumbar puncture, identified new mutations that determined a change in ART with subsequent satisfactory evolution.",0,855
1085,"Transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases requiring neonatal surgical intervention. In the desperately ill neonate with TGA and the resultant hypoxaemia, acidemia, and congestive heart failure, improvement is often obtained with balloon atrial septostomy (BAS). Current methods employed to evaluate oxygen delivery and tissue consumption are frequently nonspecific. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows a continuous non-invasive measurement of tissue oxygenation which reflects perfusion status in real time. Because little is known about the direct effect of BAS on the neonatal brain and on cerebral oxygenation, we measured the effectiveness of BAS in two patients with D-TGA using NIRS before and after BAS. We concluded BAS improves cerebral oxygen saturation in neonates with D-TGA.",0,846
1086,"BACKGROUND: The surgical treatment for low rectal cancer involves an ultra-low anterior resection with complete mesorectal resection and coloanal anastomosis. Two-stage coloanal anastomosis such as the Turnbull-Cutait technique represents an option for patients with low rectal cancer. CLINICAL CASE: A 69 year-old female patient with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (T2N1), located 4 cm from the anal margin. She received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. An ultra-low anterior resection and total resection of the mesorectum were performed. The intestinal transit was reconstructed by coloanal anastomosis using the Turnbull-Cutait technique. CONCLUSION: Coloanal anastomosis with the Turnbull-Cutait technique represents a primary option for patients with low rectal cancer, avoiding a loop ileostomy, its economic impact and on their quality of life.",0,844
1087,"BACKGROUND: Glomus tumours are neoplasms arising from cells of the neuromyoarterial glomus bodies, which almost always occur in a subungual location. A lung location is extremely rare, with few cases reported in the literature. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 33 year-old male, with non-productive cough, dyspnoea at rest, intermittent fever, and mild pain in rib cage. A chest radiograph showed a consolidation in the left lung, and computed tomography revealed a lesion in the hilum that extended to the bronchus of the lingula obstructing, and causing post-obstructive pneumonia. A biopsy was obtained by rigid bronchoscopy biopsy, which showed a well circumscribed tumour constituted by intermediate-sized cells, and abundant cytoplasm that are arranged in a pattern surrounding numerous thin-walled blood vessels, with no pleomorphism, significant mitotic activity or necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse positivity with smooth muscle actin, vimentin, caldesmon; focal reactivity with desmin and CD117, CD34 highlights the vascular pattern. Ki67 proliferation rate was 1%. Synaptophysin, EMA and cytokeratin cocktail were negative, making the diagnosis of glomus tumour. CONCLUSIONS: Glomus tumours are rare neoplasms that usually appear in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, where it is common to find glomus bodies. Occasionally glomus tumours can occur in extra-cutaneous sites such as the gastrointestinal tract, bone and respiratory system, with this case being a new case of rare lung location.",0,1527
1088,"Synchronous colonic adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated ileal neuroendocrine tumour are infrequent and are usually incidental findings on autopsies or resected surgical specimens. Only rarely are they detected on colonoscopies or during surgery. We present a case of a synchronous caecal adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated ileal neuroendocrine tumour, undetected during colonoscopy, with carcinoid metastasis in one regional lymph node not associated with adenocarcinoma metastasis. A review of the literature shows that the association of non-synchronous second primary malignancies in patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumours is reported in more than 50% of cases; however, synchronous tumours are found in only 1-8%. It would appear that well-differentiated ileal neuroendocrine tumour could be a predisposing factor for the development of a second malignancy.",0,878
1089,"A case of a girl with chronic posttraumatic osteomyelitis of the right tibia with microbiological isolation of Bacillus spp. by conventional methods and confirmation by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass) of Corynebacterium striatum is presented.

1090,"A 24-year-old female presented with catatonia and symptoms suggestive of Depressive Disorder. She also gave history of undocumented low grade irregular fever. The patient was worked up to rule out any organic cause or psychiatric illness. However, further investigations revealed immunological profile diagnostic of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with CNS involvement (CNS lupus). The diagnosis of SLE in this patient presenting with catatonia was of practical importance because catatonia as one of the manifestations of SLE or as a standalone presenting symptom is extremely rare. Hence, clinicians should be aware of this rarity so that diagnosis of Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) or catatonia as a presenting feature of SLE is never missed.",0,746
1091,"CASE REPORT: 62 year-old male with CKD stage 5 in dialysis program since 2012 who underwent surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the Unit of Metabolic Therapy at his reference hospital, where he is administered 80 millicuries of iodine-131 as a treatment associated with the surgery, unable to have his conventional dialysis, nursing interventions required in various stages of implementation of the continuous extrarenal clearance techniques (TCDE) were performed. CARE PLAN: The following care values were addressed targeted to patients undergoing treatment with I(131): specific equipment, personal protective measures and major diagnoses and nursing interventions. PROGRESS: TCDE, despite being attributed to very critical patients, they can be extrapolated to other patients in a given time. TCDE allowed these patients to undergo dialysis in a safe environment for staff, ensuring proper disposal of contaminated liquids. CONCLUSIONS: TCDE were an effective treatment for the removal of I131, a single ssesion being necessary to normalize the levels of radioactivity. Coordination between services allewed ensure proper and effective treatment for the patient.",0,1239
1092,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Skin involvement is an early, frequent and accessible location for a histopathological study. Several risk factors have been described to determine the likelihood of systemic involvement of an apparent cutaneous condition. Early diagnosis and systemic treatment could prevent future complications. A series of three cases is presented in which the initial diagnosis was cutaneous sarcoidosis, but it was actually the first manifestation of a systemic disease. A review of this topic is also presented.",0,595
1093,"BACKGROUND: Rectal prolapse is defined as the protrusion of the rectal wall through the anal canal; with a prevalence of less than 0.5%. The most frequent symptoms include pain, incomplete defecation sensation with blood and mucus, fecal incontinence and/or constipation. The surgical approach can be perineal or abdominal with the tendency for minimal invasion. Robot-assisted procedures are a novel option that offer technique advantages over open or laparoscopic approaches. CASE REPORT: 67 year-old female, who presented with rectal prolapse, posterior to an episode of constipation, that required manual reduction, associated with transanal hemorrhage during defecation and occasional fecal incontinence. A RMI defecography was performed that reported complete rectal and uterine prolapse, and cystocele. A robotic assisted Frykman-Goldberg procedure wass performed. DISCUSSION: There are more than 100 surgical procedures for rectal prolapse treatment. We report the first robot assisted procedure in Mexico. Robotic assisted surgery has the same safety rate as laparoscopic surgery, with the advantages of better instrument mobility, no human hand tremor, better vision, and access to complicated and narrow areas. CONCLUSION: Robotic surgery as the surgical treatment is a feasible, safe and effective option, there is no difference in recurrence and function compared with laparoscopy. It facilitates the technique, improves nerve preservation and bleeding. Further clinical, prospective and randomized studies to compare the different minimal invasive approaches, their functional and long term results for this pathology are needed.",0,1643
1094,"Rhinosinusitis is a very common childhood condition. Osteomyelitis is an unusual complication, which mainly occurs in toddlers and young children. The most frequent etiologic agent is Staphylococcus aureus. Iniatially, it is characterized by fever, low eyelid edema, unilateral rhinorrhea and ipsilateral palatine edema. Subsequently, abscesses develop in the maxillar yuxtanasal and/or the dental alveolar area. Secondary, it can be complicated by sequestrations, spontaneous expulsion of dental pieces and/or fistula, as well as orbital and intracranial complications. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and is confirmed by computed tomography findings. The treatment is clinical and surgical. Here we report a five year old child, with rhinosinusitis complicated by osteomyelitis of maxillary bone, mediated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.",0,879
1095,"Villaret syndrome is defined by the affection of the glossopharyngeal (IX), vagal (X), accessory (XI) and hypoglossal (XII) cranial nerves associated with ipsilateral Horner syndrome. It is caused by the compression of these nerves and the neighboring sympathetic plexus fibers at the base of the skull, particularly in the retroparotid space. Even though the invasion of the central nervous system in patients with advanced lung cancer is a frequent and well known occurrence, this particular symptomatic association is extremely rare. We are reporting the case of a newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma patient who is simultaneously developing this syndrome.",0,659
1096,"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is little known amongst clinicians and is characterised by abdominal pain and cyclical vomiting, after intense consumption of cannabis over several years. It does not respond to treatment with antiemetics, but does respond to showers in very hot water. We present the case of a 24-year-old patient whose antecedents included cannabis consumption since the age of 14 and an episode of spontaneous idiopathic pneumomediastinum (PM) the previous month, which presented an association of CHS and secondary pneumomediastinum with the intense, repeated vomiting of the CHS. He was given topical capsaicin and 5 mg of intravenous haloperidol, and was kept for 48 hours in the in A and E Short Stay Unit. This isolated clinical observation appears to indicate the need to rule out CHS as the cause of PM in young patients and, similarly, to consider the presence of PM in the clinical exploration of young people with CHS and in patients with pathologies whose aetiology might be influenced by an increase in intrathoracic pressure.",0,1063
1097,"A 52-year-old patient with multiple cardiovascular risk factors referred for unilateral, acute, and painless visual loss. In the fundoscopic image there was significant papillary inflammation with tortuosity at this level and haemorrhages. Ophthalmological examination showed papillary inflammation, macular oedema, and involvement in retinal inner layers. The control fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography angiography showed areas of central and peripheral ischaemia. Given the clinical findings and background of the patient, the diagnosis of Purtscher-like retinopathy was reached and treatment with intravitreal dexamethasone was decided. Purtscher-like retinopathy is a rare entity that occurs in patients with multiple systemic pathologies, but without a traumatic background, which differentiates it from Purstcher's retinopathy. The diagnosis and early intervention are important in the prognosis. There are no therapeutic protocols, but good results have been obtained with intravitreal therapy with dexamethasone.",0,1042
1098,"OBJECTIVE: Estramustine is an stable estradiol and nitrogenated mustard conjugatewith antymicotic properties. Currently, with the appearance of chemotherapy and new molecules, estramustin acetate is not a drug of choice for castration resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: We describe two patients with castration resistant prostate cancer under treatment with estramustine acetate and complete biochemical response and stable disease. We review the literature to elucidate if the drug should be stopped and changed for the new molecules that have demonstrated survival increase. RESULTS: To our knowledge, there are not data in the literature to either solve the questions posed or shed light regarding cumulative toxicity due to prolongued use of estramustine acetate. CONCLUSIONS: We recognize that these clinical cases do not translate that estramustine acetate is a first line treatment for patients with CRPC. Nevertheless, they translate the heterogeneity of CRPC. It would be interesting to investigate the combination of new agents with estramustine acetate as well as the search of biomarkers that enable selection of candidates who could respond to estramustine acetate.",0,1179
1099,"Adequate pupil dilation is needed to evaluate some neonates at risk of developing illness during this stage. However, this procedure is not free of adverse effects, either local or systemic. One of these complications is the local vasoconstriction of the preterm babys skin following the application of mydriatic eye drops. OBJECTIVE: To describe secondary local and systemic complications of pharmacological pupil dilation in 2 newborns. Clinical case 1: Full term baby with diagnosis of low-birth weight and hydrocephalia. An ophtalmological evaluation was performed at 5 days of age due to the presence of corneal opacities. Peri ocular pallor was observed during the procedure, as well as tachycardia and hypertension 2 hours later, spontaneosly recovered. Case 2: Preterm newborn, 27 weeks of gestational age. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalia were diagnosed at birth. At 28 days of life an ophtalmological evaluation was performed. After 10 minutes of mydriatic drops administration to evaluate preterm retinopathy, peri ocular pallor was observed, with spontaneous resolution; however, 24 hours later, the patient showed abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. Necrotizing enterocolitis was discarded, and symptoms were spontaneosly recovered. CONCLUSION: The establishment of protocols in relation to the number of drops to apply for dilation is needed to reduce deleterious effects on high risk infants, such as premature babies and those with hydrocephalus. Therefore this monitoring practice should be performed during the evaluation.",0,1629
1100,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of the Malyugin ring in poor pupil dilation during phacoemulsification assisted with femtosecond laser with 23 gauge pars plana vitrectomy. METHOD: A 57-year-old female with cataract and vitreous hemorrhage, and poor pupil dilation (5.5mm). The phacoemulsification assisted with femtosecond laser, using Malyugin ring after capsulorrhexis, followed by pars plana vitrectomy, and removing at the end without complications. RESULTS: A successfull intraoperative pupil dilation was achieved without complications, with a final BCVA of 20/40. CONCLUSIONS: The Malyugin ring is an effective alternative in cases with poor pupil dilation in femtophacovitrectomy, preserving the anatomical and functional integrity.",0,746
1101,"We report the case of a 57-year-old man who presented at the emergency department with injuries to his face and head after falling down the stairs. A head computed tomography examination done because he complained of an intense headache revealed air bubbles in the retropharyngeal space. Given this finding, a computed tomography of the neck was done to evaluate the possibility of pharyngeal perforation. Traumatic pharyngeal perforations are uncommon, but those caused by the calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, as in our case, are even more uncommon.",0,570
1102,"The hemophagocytic syndrome is a serious clinical-histological entity secondary to different diseases. Collapsing glomerulonephritis is a proliferative podocytopathy that usually has an unfavorable renal prognosis. We present a case in which both entities were associated, which is an infrequent form of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. In addition, we review the role of the markers of podocyte dedifferentiation in this glomerulopathy and its pathophysiology and treatment.",0,473
1103,"Use of Intrathecal colistin has increased in recent years and has become an alternative for the management of infections of the central nervous system caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Evidence of therapeutic success and safety profile is increasing, particularly in MDR Acinetobacter baumanii infections in adults. Conversely, evidence in children is limited. We present a case of an 11-year-old female with postsurgical meningitis caused by an extensively resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain and treated with venous and intrathecal colistin. The evidence of its use in children with nosocomial meningitis by MDR Gram negative bacteria is reviewed.",0,665
1104,Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL) is within the spectrum of cutaneous CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders. It presents as localized or multifocal tumors or plaques and carries an excellent long-term prognosis even in cases with regional and/or ipsilateral lymph node involvement or in cases of recurrent disease. We report a 34 year-old female with a thigh lesion. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PCALCL. The patient was strictly monitored but no treatment was instituted and the tumor regressed spontaneously. After 24 months of follow-up the patient remains free of disease without new lesions.,0,635
1105,"Neuralgic amyotrophy, brachial neuritis or Parsonage-Turner syndrome is a rare neuromuscular involvement of unknown aetiology. When it onsets in connection with a health care act, such as childbirth or surgery, a malpractice argument is often used as a cause of adverse outcome, usually due to an incorrect position of the patient on the operating table, a circumstance which directly involves the anesthesia area. Three cases are presented of Parsonage-Turner syndrome following very different surgery, with different results as regards prognosis. A review and discussion of bibliography is presented on the possibility that such circumstances are the subject of malpractice claims. Special emphasis is placed on the most currently accepted aetiopathogenic theories, and the relationship of this syndrome with the surgical act as a determining medico-legal aspect. Valuation parameters are proposed.",0,900
1106,"A previously healthy, immunocompetent 67-year-old female presented with a one-month history of general symptoms, weight loss, night fevers, and bilateral lower extremity edema. On admission she had severe anemia, acute kidney injury, and multiple lymphadenopathies. An excisional biopsy of one of the axillary lymphadenopathies confirmed hyaline-vascular Castleman's disease. This rare disease is a polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder that affects the normal lymph node architecture. According to its location it can be divided in unicentric (localized) or multicentric disease; it can be further divided according to histopathology in hyaline-vascular or plasmatic cells variety. Clinical presentation relates more to histopathological variety than to centricity. Human herpes virus 8 is ubiquitous in this disease and, along with interleukin 6, plays an important role in pathogenesis and symptoms presentation. Surgery is the go-to treatment of localized disease, while systemic chemotherapy is the option in multicentric disease. Communication between the clinical and anatomopathological teams is crucial; lag in diagnosis can lead to futile investigations in search of other diseases and delay in treatment.",0,1217
1107,"We report a 45-year-old male with AIDS who had a Cryptococcus neoformans central nervous system infection. He was treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate subsequently changed to voriconazole due to systemic toxicity of the former. Plasma levels of voriconazole were insufficient with a standard dose (0.7 mug/mL), therefore, the dose was increased thereafter to reach appropriate levels (4.5 mug/mL). Anti-retroviral therapy was started five weeks after voriconazole initiation with non-interacting drugs and he was discharged after a favorable evolution. He was re-admitted three months later due to seizures; a brain magnetic resonance showed new sub-cortical nodules. After excluding alternative causes and demonstrating fungal eradication, an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) event was suspected and treated with a short course of steroids. His evolution was satisfactory.",0,895
1108,"Decision-making is one of the most difficult tasks of medical judgment, especially when cases involve paediatric patients with different cultural characteristics. It is the obligation of clinical ethics, taking the interdisciplinary approach as a tool to comprehensively analyse the clinical, social, cultural and legal aspects, among other topics, when choosing the treatment options that will be more beneficial for the patient. A clinical case, should enable this process of analysis and teamwork to be understood in practical way in order to address difficult medical problems.",0,581

CASE REPORT: We report a 10 years-old girl with developmental delay, behavior problems and dysmorphic features of this new syndrome with developmental delay. She had a 12p12 deletion involving SOX5. CONCLUSIONS: We review the reported cases, intragenic SOX5 deletions and larger 12p12 deletions encompassing SOX5. We analyze the genotype-phenotype associations and the genes involved in our patient.",0,546
1110,"The case is presented of a 3 year-old girl with mitochondrial disease (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy of Leigh syndrome), v-stage chronic kidney disease of a diffuse mesangial sclerosis, as well as developmental disorders, and diagnosed with hyperthyroidism Graves-Basedow disease. Six weeks after starting the treatment with neo-carbimazole, the patient reported a serious case of agranulocytosis. This led to stopping the anti-thyroid drugs, and was treated successfully with (131)I ablation therapy. The relevance of the article is that Graves' disease is uncommon in the paediatric age range (especially in children younger than 6 years old), and developing complications due to a possible late diagnosis. Agranulocytosis as a potentially serious adverse effect following the use of anti-thyroid drugs, and the few reported cases of ablation therapy with (131)I at this age, makes this case unique.",0,912
1111,"INTRODUCTION: Flagellated dermatitis is an infrequent pathology, with characteristic skin lesions, which is developed due to the use of bleomycin. Clinically it occurs as erythematous or hyperpigmented maculae of linear disposition with flagellar pattern, in trunk and/or upper extremities. It presents self-limited evolution, therefore, its treatment varies from expectant management to the use of topical or oral corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: Presentation of a clinical case of flagellated dermatitis secondary to bleomycin in a pediatric patient with history of central nervous system neoplasia. CLINICAL CASE: 8 years, schoolchild, female, with a history of primary intracranial mixed germ cell tumor (sellar and suprasellar) and secondary panhypopituitarism. She receives chemotherapeutic treatment according to the PEB protocol, with use of IV bleomycin during three days. After two days, intermittent pruritus begins, associated with erythematous and pigmented maculae of linear distribution, followed by a flagellated pattern, with isolated signs of excoriation, in the abdominal region and upper back. Topical treatment with mild potency corticosteroids is indicated for ten days, with a satisfactory clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: There should be a high diagnostic suspi cion in pediatric patients with a history of prior administration of the drug and the appearance of characteristic skin lesions, which will allow adequate behavior regarding its management and the continuity of chemotherapy.",0,1504
1112,"UNLABELLED: Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia is an uncommon condition with multiple organ affectation and high neonatal mortality. It presents with short stature, short extremities, narrow thorax. With growth, there is respiratory improvement, but emergence of renal, hepatic, pancreatic and/or retinal impairment. OBJECTIVE: to describe the long-term evolution of 8 patients of a pediatric hospital. METHODS: we retrospectively evaluated age at diagnosis, sex, anthropometric variables, complications and radiology. RESULTS: male/female 6/2. Median age at diagnosis: 2.54 years. EVOLUTION: 8/8 respiratory compromise, 3/8 kidney, liver 2/8, 1/8 ophthalmologic, cardiac 1/8. Median height at diagnosis -1.76 DS, normal postnatal growth and body proportions. Radiology: 8/8 narrow chest and brachyphalangia in hands. 5/8 acetabular abnormalities. DISCUSSION: for surveillance it is recommended to monitor renal, liver and eye function. The pediatrician should suspect this entity in a newborn with narrow thorax and respiratory distress.",0,1035
1113,"Diarrhea-associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (D+HUS) is a multisystem disorder in which neurological involvement (35 to 50%) is associated to adverse outcome. An important cause of a permanent neurological impairment is the cerebrovascular pathology. OBJECTIVE: To report two pediatric cases of D+HUS with severe neurological involvement due to cerebrovascular disease, and review available literature. CLINICAL CASES: Two previously healthy 15- and 21-month-old children debuted with seizures and impairment of consciousness within the first week of a D+HUS. Both presented hypertension, severe acute renal failure, and focal motor deficit. One child showed significant improvement in neurologic status after five sessions of plasmapheresis. Brain magnetic resonance showed in the first child multiple bilateral infarcts of small vessels and lesions of white matter. In the second patient, large bilateral infarcts on both middle cerebral arteries territories were identified. One year after the acute event, both children showed functional impairment; The first patient evolved with language delay and spastic hemiparesis; the second patient with spastic quadriparesis, epilepsy with poor seizure control and marked functional impairment. CONCLUSION: Although most of the children with D+HUS and brain involvement do not have long-term sequelae, cerebrovascular disease in the acute period causes permanent damage, and in addition to the management of electrolyte disturbances, hypertension, and renal failure, therapies directed at specific pathophysiological mechanisms that trigger vascular compromise may improve prognosis.",0,1630
1114,"Around 5%-10% of deep vein thrombosis occurs in the upper limb. Its most frequent cause is usually cancer, central venous catheter, radio-chemotherapy or hormonal treatment. Less commonly, trauma around the shoulder region can also be a cause of deep vein thrombosis. Its diagnosis is probably more complex than in the lower limb due to its low frequency and clinical suspicion, as well as the clinical presentation, 50% of the cases being asymptomatic or presenting only with mild neck pain or omalgia. Because of their infrequency, therapeutic recommendations are based on indirect evidence from studies of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limb, considering oral anticoagulation the best treatment. We report a case of deep vein thrombosis in the upper limb after trauma to the shoulder causing grade III Rockwood acromioclavicular dislocation.",0,847
1115,"Intralymphatic histiocytosis is a benign condition characterized by poorly defined erythematous plaques (sometimes forming a reticular pattern) as well as the presence of nodules and vesicles. Its etiology and pathogenesis appear to be related to chronic inflammation in the affected area, prior surgery, or systemic disease, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. We report on 2 new cases, both associated with joint surgery in the affected area and osteoarticular disease (primary synovial osteochondromatosis and rheumatoid arthritis). This is a chronic disease and there is no specific treatment. Different treatment options were chosen in the 2 cases described. A spectacular response to treatment with oral pentoxifylline and topical tacrolimus was observed in 1 of the patients.",0,781
1116,"The case describes a 77-year-old woman with multivessel coronary disease exhibiting marked changes of T-wave morphology induced by dipyridamole, an unusual finding in which the diagnostic accuracy in this clinical context is uncertain. Gated-SPECT imaging demonstrated severe ischaemia extending through inferior and posterolateral regions of the left ventricle with normal motility and contractile function in response to vasodilator stress. Possible underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of observed electrocardiographic changes are discussed. T-loop modifications during vasodilator stress SPECT and correlation of these changes with the amount of ischaemic injury need further evaluation.",0,702
1117,"The clinical distinction between basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and intradermal melanocytic nevus lesions on the face can be difficult, particularly in young patients or patients with multiple nevi. Dermoscopy is a useful tool for analyzing characteristic dermoscopic features of BCC, such as cartwheel structures, maple leaf-like areas, blue-gray nests and dots, and ulceration. It also reveals arborizing telangiectatic vessels and prominent curved vessels, which are typical of BCC, and comma vessels, which are typical of intradermal melanocytic nevi. It is, however, not always easy to distinguish between these 2 conditions, even when dermoscopy is used. We describe 2 facial lesions that posed a clinical and dermoscopic challenge in two 38-year-old patients; confocal microscopy showed separation between tumor nests and stroma and polarized nuclei, which are confocal microscopy features of basal cell carcinoma.",0,917
1118,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the newborn is a rare entity with heterogeneous etiology. Transient forms have been described in children of mothers with gestational diabetes and in preterm infants exposed both to prenatal and postnatal corticosteroids. We report a case of a preterm infant son of a mother who received renal transplant in whom hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was detected. He had been prenatally exposed to corticosteroids and tacrolimus that received the mother as immunosuppressive therapy. Both drugs cross the placental barrier and, on reaching the fetus, could have favored its development. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be an uncommon side effect of treatment with tacrolimus in adults and children and it is reversible upon withdrawal. To our knowledge, it is the first published case of transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy after fetal exposure to both corticosteroids and tacrolimus in the son of a renal transplanted mother.",0,950
1119,"BACKGROUND: Quadratus femoris tear is an uncommon injury that usually cause hip pain, it incidence is unknown. The patient can suffer of posterior gluteal pain or groin pain or both, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult, because the differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad. CLINICAL CASE: A 65 years old male, with gluteal and groin pain presented during tennis; evaluated by neurologist with lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (normal) and referred to physical therapy, a pelvic MRI was required, finding an unsuspected quadratus femoris tear. CONCLUSION: MRI with its superior soft-tissue resolution and multiplanar capability is an excellent adjunct to physical examination because it shows the anatomic location of the abnormality, aiding the clinician to make unsuspected diagnoses.",0,805
1120,"BACKGROUND: Aspergillus tracheobronchitis (ATB) is an uncommon type of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in which fungal involvement is limited to the tracheobronchial tree. While the more severe forms, such as pseudomembranous and ulcerative ATB, occur almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, the milder obstructive form may occur in patients without immune deficiency. CASE REPORT: The case of a 32 year-old man with no previous history of illness, who was evaluated for recurrent right lower lobe pneumonia, is presented. Microbiological sputum studies revealed growth of Serratia marcescens, and a limited growth of Aspergillus fumigatus, the latter interpreted as a contaminant in the specimen. Bronchoscopy revealed a dense mucous plug at level B10 of the right lower lobe, which could not be removed; no other macroscopic findings of interest were observed. During his hospital admission, the patient expectorated the mucous plug and had a significant subsequent bronchorrhoea. A substantial number of colonies of A. fumigatus grown in the sputum cultures. The patient was given voriconazole, leading to a clinical resolution, with no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive ATB is characterised by the excessive production of thick, hyphae-laden mucus, which can obstruct the airway lumen and generate relapsing post-obstructive pneumonias. It is important to consider this diagnosis in immunocompetent patients with recurrent respiratory infections and who show repeated isolation of Aspergillus colonies in the sputum, even in small quantities.",0,1561
1121,"Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic airborne mycosis that may involve secondarily other organs through systemic dissemination. Fungi Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are the etiologic agents. The former is ubiquitous from the area of California in North America, and the latter is found elsewhere in the world. Primary cutaneous infection is rare. We present six Mexican male cases, residents of Tijuana B.C. Three of them with primary pulmonary infection and further cutaneous dissemination, and three cases of primary cutaneous coccicioidomycosis. In half the cases C. posadasii was isolated. The clinical suspicion is basic for reaching the diagnosis, and we must always keep in mind that the cutaneous manifestations are widely varied and that the lesions are more severe when systemic dissemination occurs.",0,813
1122,"We present the case of a patient who, during studies for fertility and subsequent pregnancy, showed an altered thyroid profile with elevated levels of free T4 and normal TSH. After ruling out a thyrotropic adenoma and in the absence of clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, the possibility of analytical interference in the immunoassays used to measure hormones was investigated. Interferences caused by heterophile antibodies, macro TSH, anti-thyroid antibodies, biotin, and to a lesser extent anti-streptavidin and anti-ruthenium antibodies have been described. The analysis of the patient was carried out in a self-analyzer whose platform uses the streptavidin-biotin system that is very susceptible to several interferents. A proposed algorithm includes a series of simple tests to perform and interpret that allow detecting or ruling out the presence of interferents. Accordingly, a comparison was made with a different analytical platform (which does not use the streptavidin-biotin system), serial dilutions, precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 and treatment with microparticles coated with streptavidin. Results obtained confirmed the presence of anti-streptavidin antibodies in the patient's serum. In the case of disagreements between clinical manifestations and laboratory results, the possibility of methodological interferences should be investigated in order to avoid the potential iatrogenic risk involved in an erroneous biochemical interpretation.",0,1472
1123,"Solitary fibrous tumours/haemangiopericytomas (SFT/HPC) are fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasms that harbour a genetic fusion of NAB2/STAT6. There are few reported cases in the central nervous system (CNS), of which spinal tumours are minority. We present a case of a 63-year-old woman with progressive paraparesis and a sensory level of T6. On the MRI we detected an intradural extramedullary lesion on T9-T10. We performed a laminectomy with an intraoperative ultrasound study in which we observed a heterogeneous lesion with an infiltrating pattern affecting the medulla at several points, and resection of the lesion. Immunohistological findings revealed positivity for vimentin, CD34 and STAT6; Ki-67 was 2%. A final diagnosis of SFT/HPC with SFT phenotype was made. SFT/HPC of the CNS is a rare neoplasm that should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of these kinds of lesions, as clinical and MRI findings often lead to errors in diagnostic approach. The support of intraoperative ultrasound can assist in surgical decision-making.",0,1054
1124,"Postpartum headache can be due to many causes. In a patient with previous epidural analgesia, the headache can be attributed to post-dural puncture headache, even if the symptoms are not typical of this clinical entity. We report a case of a post-partum with accidental dural tap during the insertion of an epidural catheter for labour analgesia, and who referred to headaches in the third post-partum day. Initially, a post-dural puncture headache was suspected, but the subsequent onset of seizures and visual impairment meant that the diagnosis had to be reconsidered. In this case report, the clinical and pathophysiological features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, as well as the differential diagnosis of post-partum headaches are described.",0,814
1125,"Cardiovascular complications, in particular perioperative myocardial infarctions, are central contributors to morbidity and mortality after non-cardiac surgery. We present a case of a 41-year-old male, smoker and dyslipidemic, who underwent bimaxillary orthognathic jaw surgery with the development of an acute coronary syndrome in the immediate postoperative period. We managed to early diagnose the myocardial infarction and promptly performed a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, resulting in a positive outcome.",0,528

Despite the therapeutic efforts, the patient died. Lung pathology revealed Usual Interstitial Pneumonia.",0,565
1127,"Elevated level of ammonia in the blood, defined as hyperammonemia, is feasible to cause neurological symptoms when crossing the blood-brain barrier. The most frequent and studied cause of hyperammonemia is liver failure. Nevertheless, other less frequent and known etiologies must be considered. Urinary tract infection caused by urea-splitting bacteria, despite being unusual in pediatric patients, must be taken into account. We report a pediatric patient with severe acute encephalopathy and high levels of ammonia in blood. After ruling out other causes of hyperammonemia, it was assumed secondary to urinary tract infection by Corynebacterium riegelii, a ureasplitting bacteria. General treatment for hyperammonemic encephalopathy was established, as well as specific treatment with antibiotics. The patient evolved favorably.",0,831
1128,"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as weakness in both proximal and distal muscles with globally diminished or absent reflexes. Insulin neuritis is referred as an acute pain in the extremities, due to the damage of peripheral nerves affecting mainly small fibers, in diabetic patients treated with insulin who achieved rapid glycemic control. Pain is unusual in classic CIDP. We report the case of a 54-year-old female patient with type II diabetes mellitus, and a recent onset of insulin therapy, who presented at the emergency room with a 2-month history of weakness and hyperalgesia of extremities. Physical examination showed marked pain and proximal and distal allodynia in the 4 limbs, with reduced muscle strength of the proximal muscles and patellar and achillear areflexia. Electrophysiological study showed sensory and motor polyneuropathy with a demyelinating predominance. Treatment with recombinant human immunoglobin was started, and the patient presented a total remission of the condition. Complementary studies confirmed weak serum positivity of GM1, GD1a, GD1b and anti-asialo GM1. Prior to hospital discharge, results of positive serum VDRL and FTA-Abs were received. VDRL in cerebrospinal fluid was negative, so neurosyphilis was ruled out, and treatment with benzathine penicillin was indicated.",0,1389
1129,"Congenital tuberculosis is a rare disease with a high mortality rate. Congenital tuberculosis is considered the result of mother-to-child transmission from the placenta to the fetus, through the ingestion of the amniotic fluid, or via transplacental transmission through the umbilical vein. Given the non-specific clinical signs of tuberculosis, it is usually difficult to diagnose it. The case of a 48-day-old male infant hospitalized due to weight loss, fever, cough, hemoptysis, and respiratory distress for the past 20 days, is presented. In this period, he had received broad spectrum antibiotics but with no improvement. A chest x-ray showed the presence of consolidation and a cavitary lesion in the upper and middle left lung fields. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by polymerase chain reaction in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. Congenital tuberculosis was diagnosed based on this finding; hence, a tuberculostatic regimen was started accordingly. The patient died 13 days after treatment initiation. Congenital tuberculosis should be considered in infants with weight loss, fever, cough, hemoptysis and respiratory distress.",0,1145
1130,"The first two living donor kidney transplants in our country (isotransplant and homotransplant respectively) were reported in 1961. We reviewed the clinical history of the renal homotransplant performed between father and son, more than half a century ago, by Carlos Younger de la Pena and Ramiro Rivera at ""La Paloma' Clinic in Madrid. We comment on the organizational, legal, immunobiological and technical difficulties in those times when the successful future of transplantation was barely in sight. From the XXI Century we can see the long path of renal transplantation during the XX century. Despite all the initial troubles and failures our present must recognize, and so does it, the work and dedication of the pioneers.",0,728
1131,"Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a high risk for developing invasive fungal infections (IFI). Treatment is difficult due to the interaction between the antifungal and immunosuppressant drugs, as well as the risk of hepatotoxicity and kidney failure associated with voriconazole and amphotericinB, respectively. Isavuconazole is a new antifungal triazole agent with excellent oral bioavailability, predictable and linear pharmacokinetics, good tolerance and low adverse effects. It has been approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. A review is presented of the reported experience in the use of isavuconazole in SOT. According to the published studies, isavuconazole has a significantly lower risk of interaction with tacrolimus, and is less hepatotoxic than voriconazole. Nevertheless, there is a significant variability between patients, and between each type of SOT. Isavuconazole reduces the side effects associated with the treatment of IFI in SOT. It would be of great interest the implementation of future clinical trials with isavuconazole for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of IFI in these patients.",0,1151

This is the third procedure and the patient is treated with a surgical excision of the tumour and cryotherapy at the surgical bed. Due to the risk of recurrence, topical Mitomycin C 0,02% was added at post-operative care achieving a good clinical outcome. DISCUSSION: Surgical exeresis with cryotherapy and topical Mitomycin C is an effective treatment for a case of an atypical fibroxanthoma with a high potential for recurrence and invasion.

Although cutaneous manifestations are among the most common clinical signs of Zika, they are not specific and very few images are available. We present 3 patients (2 travelers and 1 immigrant) in whom a rash was the presenting manifestation of Zika virus infection. Prompt diagnosis optimizes outcomes in these patients, improves the management of severe disease, and minimizes the risk of local transmission by Aedes albopictus, now a potential local vector for the virus due to its presence in areas along Spain's Mediterranean coast.",0,753
1137,"INTRODUCTION: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody encephalitis was initially described as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated to ovarian teratomas. Yet, an increasing number of reports are being published involving cases of young women and children with signs and symptoms of an autoimmune encephalopathy, in 40-50% of the cases secondary to a viral infection. Clinically, it is characterised by a progressive picture of psychiatric manifestations, convulsive seizures, dyskinesias and dysautonomias. One neuroimaging finding that has received little attention is reversible cortical atrophy, the underlying mechanism of which is unknown. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who started with focal convulsive seizures, with an abnormal epileptogenic electroencephalogram and an initial tomography scan of the head that was normal. Anticonvulsive treatment was established. At three weeks new convulsive seizures, psychiatric manifestations and disorders in the sleep-arousal cycle appeared. Suspecting a case of anti-NMDA antibody receptor encephalitis, analyses were performed to test for the presence of these antibodies in serum and in cerebrospinal fluid, the results being positive. Magnetic resonance imaging conducted during hospitalisation revealed generalised cortical atrophy. The Paediatric Oncology department ruled out any association with tumours. Two years after onset of the clinical picture, with the patient free of convulsive seizures, a neuropsychological appraisal was carried out. Results showed involvement of the executive functions and a follow-up magnetic resonance scan revealed recovery from the cortical atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism underlying reversible cortical atrophy is unknown but in patients with anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis it could be directly proportional to the amount of antibodies in circulation and the length of time the cerebral cortex was exposed to them. An early diagnosis and initiating immunomodulation are essential.",0,2020
1138,"Exposing a child to a potentially toxic substance is an uncommon cause of consultation in childhood. Poisoning by drugs in this age group is commonly due to improper administration by parents or error in dosage by the doctor; also ingestion at own initiative, i.e. self-poisoning. CASE REPORT: A 11 years-old male, drowsy, unresponsive, with bradypsychia, assisted ambulation without increased support arch, resting tremor; obeying orders without verbal response, isochoric pupils, difficulty opening the eyes without facial asymmetry, muscle contracture of platysma, increased muscle tone, tendon reflexes slightly increased, arrhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. On interrogation, the subject mentioned his own decision to ingest about 0.7-0.9 mg of haloperidol (0.35-0.45 ml / 7-9 drops). Laboratory studies: BUN 12 mg/dl; creatinine 0.5 mg/dl; Na 140 mmol/l; K 3.38 mmol/l; Cl 100.2 mmol/l; LDH 363 U/l; CK 130 U/l; CK-MB 13 U/l. Electrocardiogram DII length (13:00 h) with sinus rhythm, FC 100 x, corrected QT 0.57; stroke control (19:20 h) FC 70 x, QTc of 0.41 (Fig. 1). He was treated with diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg/dose with clear improvement at 12 hours after admission, so his discharge at 24 hours was decided without any additional medication.",0,1256
1139,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital penile curvature (CPC) is caused by a disorder in the embryonic development of the urethra and corpora cavernosa. The condition causes difficulty for penetration, requiring surgical correction when it prevents intercourse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the cases of 2 men in their 40s who had ventral curvature greater than 60 degrees of 2 years of evolution, with maintained erections. The patients underwent surgery for rotation of the corpora cavernosa. After the complete denudation of the penis, athermal release of the neurovascular bundle of the penis from the ventral side to the dorsal was performed. Once the curvature was verified using artificial erection, an incision was performed in the tunica albuginea of both corpora cavernosa, continuously suturing both internal and external margins with resorbable monofilament. The rectification of the curvature was then checked, and the mucocutaneous plane was reconstructed. RESULTS: The surgical time was 120minutes and there were no intraoperative complications. Both patients were discharged 24h after the surgery. At 1 week, the patients experienced spontaneous night-time erections and were able to maintain sexual relations 1 month after the surgery. At 6 months, the residual curvature was less than 20 degrees , the penile shortening was less than 1 centimeter and the International Index of Erectile Function-5 was 25 for both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for rotation of the corpora cavernosa helps correct CPC without significant penile shortening or erectile dysfunction. In our opinion, the procedure is an appropriate treatment for patients with CPC but requires studies with long-term follow-up in order to consider it the technique of choice.",0,1743
1140,"INTRODUCTION: Umbilical laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery represents an excellent alternative to laparoscopic or robotic multiport surgery. LESS surgery offers faster recovery, less postoperative pain and optimal cosmetic results. LESS is possible in virtually any urologic surgery. PATIENT AND METHOD: We present a 38-year-old male with BMI 31.2 and with history of stage I nonseminomatous mixed germ cell tumor showing interaortocaval lymph node recurrence without elevation of tumor markers. Patient was undergone to right laparoendoscopic single-site retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LDRP-LESS) by umbilical approach using a single-site multichannel KeyPort (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany). RESULTS: After the placement of the device and triangulation of the clips, we proceeded to operate on posterior parietal peritoneum. The descending colon was mobilized to access the retroperitoneum. Complete retroperitoneal lymph node dissection on the right side from iliac vessels to renal vessels, including the paracaval and interaortocaval space, was performed. The specimen was inserted into a laparoscopic bag and was removed together with multichannel system. Abdominal drainage was not employed. Surgical time was 85 min and estimated bleeding 50 cc. The patient was very satisfied with the cosmetic results and was discharged the following day without needing analgesia. The pathology report revealed metastatic seminoma in 5 of 11 lymph nodes receiving systemic chemotherapy (VP16-CDDPs) for 4 cycles with good tolerance. A year later, the patient was disease-free and had no complications. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical primary LDRP-LESS, with excellent oncologic and cosmetic results, is feasible in selected cases. This approach could be considered the least invasive surgical option economically advantageous due to the reusable nature of the instruments used.",0,1889
1141,"Ecthyma gangrenosum is an uncommon necrotizing vasculitis, in most cases secondary to sepsis by Pseudo-mona aeruginosa in immunocompromised patients. However, there have been several reports of ecthyma gangre-nosum caused by other infectious etiologies.

1142,"INTRODUCTION: Limbic encephalitis generated by anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies is a severe acute neurological condition that is more prevalent in young females and is associated with an underlying tumour. The appearance of severe initial psychiatric signs and symptoms and the fact that it is accompanied by emotional disorders and severe cognitive impairment make it necessary to reconsider the contributions of neuropsychiatry to the diagnosis, development and treatment of the disease, since these have received little attention from researchers to date. CASE REPORT: We report on what is, to our knowledge, the only case in Navarra, associated with an ovarian teratoma, with special attention paid to its assessment, intervention and neuropsychiatric development. CONCLUSION: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a disease that is usually accompanied by predominant psychiatric manifestations at the outset of the illness, together with cognitive deterioration that commonly affects memory and the executive functions. Treatment consisting in beginning a process of rehabilitation that includes compensatory strategies for deficits, cognitive stimulation and psychopharmacological treatment in the recovery phase has proved to be effective.",0,1263
1143,"Since 1900, hip fusion was considered a definitive treatment, being the method of choice for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip in young patients, and others as infections or sequelae of childhood illnesses, although today it has been migrated to the use of prostheses with non-cemented implants. Currently orthopedic management of osteoarthritis in the hip of the young patient has changed dramatically in part derived from the consequences of long-term arthrodesis in adjacent joints, so we present this case where we perform the conversion to total hip arthroplasty.",0,565
1144,"Lymphedema is the result of an alteration of the lymphatic drainage, and its most common worldwide cause is filariasis. In our practice usually is associated to neoplasic, inflammatory and granulomatous processes, radiotherapy, hydroelectrolytic disbalances, and idiopathic. It can affect any part of the body, including the penis and scrotum. The genital lymphedema is a rare presentation, it corresponds to 0.6% of lymphedema. However, causes serious functional, social and emotional limitations for the patient. Too often have pain, recurrent infections, sexual dysfunction, cosmetic deformity, sometimes it limits mobility and ambulation. Although there are several treatment options, both medical and surgical, it has not been found ideal for this disease. We present a 43 years old patient with penoscrotal lymphedema due to hidradenitis suppurativa, it limits his normal activity. The patient was referred to our center after unsuccessful medical treatment (doxycycline and clindamycin cycles). Surgical treatment consisted of total excision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue to Buck's fascia. Split thickness skin grafts were used to cover the defect. The result was satisfactory both functionally and aesthetically.",0,1226
1145,"Hydronephrosis is a common finding in urinary tract outflow obstruction. Chronically obstructed hydronephrotic system may be associated with parenchymal changes. Ultrasound, intravenous urography, micturating cysto-urethrogram and scintigraphy are commonly performed to evaluate the cause of obstruction. In childhood, pelviureteric junction obstruction is a common cause of the hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis can also be present in horseshoe kidneys due to poor drainage. However, a large sized hydronephrotic cavity may obscure the finding of horseshoe kidney. A case was reported, and it was diagnosed as horseshoe kidney on follow-up renal dynamic scan and confirmed with the help of dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT/CT.",0,721
1146,"CASE REPORT: We report a case of primary small-cell lymphocytic lacrimal gland lymphoma in a male diagnosed with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These rare lymphomas are usually presented in the clinic as disseminations secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and the primary site is rare in the orbit. DISCUSSION: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumours. Although treatment in the IE stage is usually radiotherapy, due to its association with antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic treatment with rituximab was administered.",0,548

Although it is a congenital malformation, it may not be diagnosed until late childhood, with patients presenting with a painless deformity of the middle third of the clavicle in the absence of prior trauma. The treatment is controversial, and may be surgical, depending on the functional impact and aesthetics. A case of bilateral involvement is presented, together with a review of the relevant literature.",0,551
1149,"In recent years, the use of vaccines has been standardized within vaccination programs. Adverse effects at the puncture site are usually mild and transient. Nevertheless, in some cases, persistence subcutaneous nodules can develop; these are often underdiagnosed because they are so rare and because of the long time that can transpire between the vaccination and their appearance. Histologically, they consist of a lymphoid follicular hyperplasia that occurs as a reaction to the aluminum particles usually used as an adjuvant in some vaccines. We were unable to find any reference in the radiological literature to these soft-tissue nodules secondary to vaccination. We report the characteristic ultrasound findings that will enable radiologists to identify or strongly suspect these lesions and thereby avoid unnecessary imaging tests that might lead to confusion and inadequate management of these patients.",0,911

Muniz in Buenos Aires (Argentina) due to a severe lower back pain. He had a history of several highly active antiretroviral therapy treatments and he also had diabetes and chronic B and C viral hepatitis. A spinal cord CT scan showed two lytic bone lesions in L2 and L3. A bone biopsy was carried out and its microbiological study allowed the isolation of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Intravenous vancomycin was prescribed, together with a corset and physical rest. A few days later the patient presented with acute dermatitis with papules, vesicles, scales and erythema, which spread over the whole lumbar region. The mycological study of the scales led to the isolation in culture of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. With the diagnosis of decubitus candidiasis he was initially treated with a topical ointment containing 3% salicylic acid and 6% benzoic acid, but only slow, partial improvement was observed. The treatment was changed to oral fluconazole at a daily dose of 200mg. With the latter the patient showed a rapid, complete clinical response.",0,1233
1152,"Hydrocarbon aspiration (HA) can cause significant lung disease by inducing an inflammatory response, hemorrhagic exudative alveolitis, and loss of surfactant function. The most serious side effect of HA is aspiration pneumonia. Pneumothorax, pneumatocele, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary abscess, bronchopleural fistula, bilateral hemorrhagic pleural effusion and pyopneumothorax were previously reported. Hereby we report a patient hospitalized due to aspiration pneumonia who developed pleurisy and pneumothorax after drinking paint thinner. It is presented as it was seldom reported in children to cause distinct pulmonary complications. Patients with complaints associated withhydrocarbon poisoning must be fully evaluated. They must not be discharged from the hospital early and must be followed for at least 48 hours even if they don't have respiratory symptoms. It should be kept in mind that severe pulmonary complications can develop in patients with chemical pneumonia.",0,1001

On administration of 22ml of 0.75% bupivacaine the patient suffered a total spinal block with widespread loss strength and respiratory arrest. The patient required emergency orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, where extubation was achieved within two hours without incidences. At a later stage it was stated that the local anaesthetic had been administered via the access port for bolus or contrast administration instead of via the access to the reservoir. Analysis of the incident showed up latent factors related to absence lack of personnel training and internal protocols. The following measures were taken: pain unit meeting, alert sent to SENSAR bulletin and training request for members of the service.",0,867
1155,"Staphylococcus aureus is a known pathogen in pediatric patients that produces skin infections, cutaneous abscess, cellulitis and osteoarticular infections. Most of these infections are produced by a meticilin susceptible strain. The community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was published for the first time in 1993, ever since then is has been recognized as a cosmopolite pathogen. The first report in Latin America was published in 2003, and in Chile in 2008 from adult patients that have reported traveling to other countries. The following series describes four pediatric cases, all school-aged children, diagnosed since 2012 with clinical followups and molecular studies. Two cases presented as osteomyelitis of the lower extremity; and one presented as arm cellulitis. These three cases had Panton Valentine leukocidine (PV-L) negative strains from the clone complex 8.

We report a 69 years old diabetic women admitted with a septic shock. An abdominal CAT scan showed a pan-colitis that seemed to be infectious. A polymerase chain reaction was positive for Clostridium Difficile. Due to the failure to improve after full medical treatment, a derivative loop ileostomy and intra-operatory colonic lavage were performed, leaving a Foley catheter in the proximal colon. In the postoperative period, anterograde colonic instillations of Vancomycin flushes through the catheter were performed every 6 hours. Forty eight hours after surgery, the patient improved.

1157,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an exanthematous viral disease caused mainly by Coxsackie A16 with a typical symptomatology of fever, papulovesicular rash on the hands, feet, and genitals, and an ulcerous enanthem in the mouth. In the summer of 2016, a variety of cases presented at a hospital in Callao in children and adults with a symptomatology consistent with HFMD. A clinical diagnosis was made, and support therapy was applied, resulting in the resolution of symptoms. In the last decade, reports have emerged in some countries of an atypical involvement caused by Coxsackie A6, producing lesions that are more widely distributed in adults. However, the diagnosis remains clinical, only requiring virological confirmation in atypical cases or when the diagnosis is unclear. The importance of this report stems from its description of the cases in Callao that occurred in the summer of 2016 and serve as an example for health professionals in the diagnosis and management of patients with similar symptomatology.",0,1026
1158,"Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) or IgA Vasculitis is the most common childhood vasculitis. The classic tetrad of signs and symptoms include palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal disease. The occurrence of hemorrhagic bullae in children with HSP is rarely encountered. Objec tive: To report an unusual cutaneous manifestation of HSP in children. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old girl complained about a 2-week painful bullous rash in both lower extremities and multiple arthral gias. There was no history of abdominal pain or urinary symptoms. In both lower extremities, there were numerous palpable purpura and hemmorrhagic bullae. In light of clinical findings, laboratory tests and skin biopsy are requested. The histopathology described intraepidermal blisters, acanthosis, spongiosis and perivascular dermal infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence (IFD) (+) for IgA. The diagnosis of bullous HSP was made and treatment with endovenous corticosteroids was initiated. Three days after overlapping to oral corticosteroids, new ecchymotic lesions appeared in both legs. Due to the persistence of cutaneous involvement and negative control tests, azathioprine was associa ted obtaining a good response. CONCLUSION: Although bullous lesions in HSP does not add morbidity, it is often an alarming phenomenon with multiple differential diagnoses. The anti-inflamatory effect of corticoids is likely to be beneficial in the treatment of patients with severe cutaneous involvement through inhibition of proinflammatory transcription factors and decreasing the production of the metalloproteinases.",0,1599

Its metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine, is metabolized through thiopurine methyltransferase. Patients with low enzyme activity may have more frequent and severe side effects. The most common is leukopenia, and rarely pancytopenia. The thiopurine methyltransferase activity monitoring shows an individualized profile of enzymatic activity but it should not replace monitoring by performing serial blood counts. In patients with fever and severe neutropenia, early empirical antibiotic treatment should be initiated to prevent severe and disseminated infection. Two patients with this condition are reported.",0,712

CHIK infection has been considered not severe and with very unusual mortality, however DEN is associated with severe manifestations and increased mortality. Little is known about coinfection. It is possible that co-infection could generate severe cases. We present a case report of co-infection DEN-V -3 and CHIK-V in an elderly patient who developed acute renal failure, dengue shock syndrome (DSS), progresses to multiple organ failure and died. With the recent emergence of CHIK-V in Colombia, the possibility of co-infection with DEN-V should be suspected, especially in severe cases.",0,715

Up next, we present a case that exemplifies this situation. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case report that exemplifies this new outlook in young people and how it affects their mental health. METHODOLOGY: Case report and non-systematic literature review. RESULTS: One case report, treated at a hospital in Medellin due to two suicide attempts related to social networks is presented. DISCUSSION: Currently, there are multiple social media resources, the advent of internet and smartphones is not only a strategy for improving social interactions, but it also contributes to impair mental health of some vulnerable young people. CONCLUSION: This case sensitize us, about the relationship between the growing social networking and cyberbullying as well as suicidal thoughts / attempts; thanks to this case and the available literature, we can't establish causality but we could deduce that the internet utter a increased risk for young people who are exposed and more vulnerable.",0,1196
1165,"Background: Airway hemangiomas are congenital neoplasms of low incidence. Its clinical presentation consists of obstruction of the upper airway with progressive dyspnea and stridor and the life of the patient at risk. Infantile hemangiomas have an incidence at birth of 2%, increasing to 9% at 12 months of life. Almost 60% of childhood hemangiomas affect the head and neck region. However, localization in the upper airway is not as frequent and it is only reported in 1.8% of patients with cutaneous hemangiomas. The traditional treatment of laryngeal hemangiomas has been the administration of systemic corticosteroids for long periods, endolaryngeal surgery with CO2 laser, open surgery, tracheostomy or, recently, oral propranolol. Case report: Five cases of subglottic hemangioma treated with systemic propranolol are presented. The therapeutic time of response with the satisfactory control of obstructive symptoms and assurance of the airway was evaluated. In these cases, propranolol was shown to be an effective and safe option for the treatment of laryngeal hemangiomas with a therapeutic response time of 48 to 72 hours. Conclusions: In recent years, the treatment with oral propranolol has become the first therapeutic option due to its high efficacy and safety profile.",0,1283

We present two case reports of M. lentiflavum lymphadenitis diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in the last 10 years. Routine tests were performed after persistent adenopathy, and a sample for culture was obtained, being positive for this microorganism. Both patients received oral antibiotics during several weeks. Case 1 needed complete excision after five months of treatment, whilst Case 2 was cured by medical therapy. M. lentiflavum is considered, among the newly described nontuberculous mycobacterial species, an emergent pathogen in our environment. It has its own microbiological and clinical characteristics, different from the rest of nontuberculous mycobacteria.

1168,"INTRODUCTION: We present our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of spinal angiolipomas (SAL). METHODS: We used our database of surgical patients to gather epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up data from confirmed cases of SAL. Patients' functional status was evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score for thoracic myelopathy. RESULTS: We included 7 patients with ages ranging between 42 and 63 years; 4 were women. Lesions in all patients were located in the thoracic epidural space; in 2 cases, lesions extended outside the spinal canal. The most frequent form of presentation was pain combined with progressive myelopathy; patients scored 5 to 9 points on the mJOA scale. Radiological findings varied; this variability clearly depended on the proportion of tumour components (cellular variant in one case, predominantly angiomatous in another, and myxoid in yet another case). Four cases displayed radiological signs of bone involvement. Surgery resulted in excellent mJOA scores except in one case (mJOA score of 10); no recurrences were detected during follow-up (periods ranging from 1 to 5 years). CONCLUSIONS: Extradural SAL can present with highly variable radiological and clinical features. Surgery must be tailored to each individual situation according to tumour extension; in some cases, it may include spinal reconstruction. Surgery results in excellent outcomes regardless of preoperative functional status and it is associated with low recurrence rates, even in case of incomplete resection.",0,1575

1170,"CASE REPORT: a 75-year old woman who had had cataract surgery in her left eye and showed a visual acuity of 0.8 twenty-four hours post-surgery. Biomicroscopy revealed a foreign body attached to the iris in the nasal sector that coincided with the main incision of the phacoemulsification, which was then removed in a second surgical procedure. It was analysed and described as an inert structure made of plastic. DISCUSSION: The possible origin of the presence of a fragment of plastic in the postoperative period following cataract surgery is established. In this case, its inert nature did not cause any further intraocular inflammation. Its rigid structure also favoured its attachment to the iris, thus avoiding any other complications. There must be greater preventative measures during cataract surgery, including checking the instruments and accessories before and after the surgical procedure.",0,901
1171,"Intravascular leiomyomatosis is a rare condition characterized by histologically benign smooth muscle cell growth within the uterine veins and inferior vena cava and, rarely, into the right chambers of the heart. A 39-year-old female with a history of hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma was admitted for lower limb oedema and progressive dyspnea of 5 months' duration. Transthoracic echocardiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a large mass extending through the inferior vena cava into the right chambers of the heart. As there was a suspicion of an intravenous thrombus, the patient underwent surgical resection.

These ulcers appear in young women who have not had previous sexual intercourse or after a period of sexual abstinence. We present a 10-year-old girl with painful vulvar ulcers with a 3-day history of diarrhea and fever before the onset of the lesions. A complete anamnesis and detailed physical examination were carried out and complementary tests were performed to investigate sexually and non-sexually transmitted disease; the results were negative. Symptomatic treatment was started; at one-month follow-up a complete resolution of ulcers confirmed the diagnosis of ulcer of Lipschutz.",0,776
1175,"BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts are dural diverticula with liquid content similar to cerebrospinal fluid, with 1% occurring in the spinal cord. They locate mainly in the dorsal region of the thoracic spine, and are unusual causes of spinal cord compression. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a previously healthy 15-year-old boy, with a 20-month history of spastic paraparesis that started apparently after epidural block for ankle osteosynthesis. There was decreased sensitivity and strength of the pelvic limbs and gradually presented with anaesthesia from T12 to L4 dermatomes, L5 and S1 bilateral hypoaesthesia and 4+/5 bilateral strength, in the L2 root and 2+/5 in L3, L4, L5, S1, hyperreflexia, Babinski and clonus, but with no alteration in the sacral reflexes. In the magnetic resonance it was diagnosed as an extradural arachnoid cyst from T6 to T9. The patient underwent a T6 to T10 laminotomy, cyst resection, dural defect suture, and laminoplasty. One year after surgery, the patient had recovered sensitivity, improvement of muscle strength up to 4+/5 in L2 to S1, and normal reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: After the anaesthetic procedure, increased pressure and volume changes within the cyst could cause compression of the spinal cord, leading to symptoms. Despite being a long-term compression, the patient showed noticeable improvement.",0,1348
1177,"Primary intraosseous meningiomas are considered extradural meningiomas when no dural attachment is present. Most of them arise from the cranial bones and can present either as an osteoblastic or an osteolytic lesion. Osteolytic intraosseous meningiomas are the rarest and very few cases have been reported. Given that many of these may develop signs of malignancy, early histological confirmation is important in order to ensure appropriate treatment. The recommended therapy is surgery, with complete resection whenever possible. We present the case of a large primary intraosseous osteolytic meningioma within the occipital bone, which was completely excised five years ago, currently presenting no signs of recurrence.",0,721
1178,"The hyalinizing trabecular adenoma is a rare lesion of the thyroid. There is controversy in the literature about the correct name for this disease. Dr. Carney defended the benign nature of this condition and therefore continues calling it adenoma, the World Health Organization calls for the potential of tumor malignancy, and others qualify it as a variant of papillary carcinoma based on the presence of rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma (RET/PTC) rearrangements. In Latin America there are few reported cases. Two cases of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma are reported. The first is a 40-year-old woman with a thyroid nodule of 3x3 cm. The immunohistochemistry was positive for thyroglobulin and calcitonin and negative for cytokeratin 19 and chromogranin. The second case is a 36-year-old patient with a thyroid nodule of 4x4 cm with an immunohistochemical pattern identical to the first case. Trabecular hyalinizing adenoma is a benign disease, easily confused with papillary or medullary thyroid carcinoma. Awareness of this entity will allow a better classification and management of thyroid conditions.",0,1131
1179,"Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance includes all renal disorders caused by a monoclonal immunoglobulin secreted by a non-malignant B-cell clone. Patients with MGRS do not, by definition, meet criteria for multiple myeloma, with haematological disorders generally considered to be monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Nevertheless, the renal involvement can be serious and require specific treatment. Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders, including the recently discovered C3 glomerulopathy. Development of C3 glomerulopathy in the context of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance after kidney transplantation is uncommon and very few cases have been published to date. We report on three cases of C3 glomerulopathy in the context of de novo monoclonal gammopathy after kidney transplantation.",0,876
1180,"CASE REPORT: A 35 year-old male patient with a history of HIV infection characterized by progressive tumour growth in bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye, corresponding to conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma that responded to treatment with interferon alpha-2a. DISCUSSION: Interferon alpha-2b has been used at conjunctival level as a topical immunomodulator treatment, with complete remission of epithelial neoplasms being observed. However, there have not been any previous publications on the use of interferon alpha-2a, which differs from interferon alpha-2b in a single amino acid, for the treatment of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma.",0,645
1181,"Sarcomas account for less than 1% of malignant breast tumors. We present the case of a sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) of the breast that debuted as a lump. The patient associated the lump with trauma, and the clinical, sonographic, and cytological findings were suggestive of a hematoma. The lump grew rapidly, and the follow-up sonogram one month later clearly revealed hypervascular solid poles. This atypical presentation is useful for reviewing the management of lesions suggestive of hematomas, which are often associated with nonspecific findings and occasionally with signs that raise suspicion of malignancy. The emergence of what appears to be a hematoma in the breast, even when accompanied by a history of trauma or a tendency toward bleeding, calls for prudence: very short-term follow-up and biopsy, even excisional biopsy, are recommended if the lesion does not evolve like a hematoma.",0,909
1182,"Lichen aureus is a rare pigmented purpuric dermatosis. We present an unusual case because of the pediatric age and the great number of lesions with zosteriform distribution. He is a 10-yearold boy, with a brownish, smaller than 1 cm, sharp edges, lichenified surface, asymptomatic macule, over the inner aspect of the left leg with a zosteriform distribution. The histology showed a band-like inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis, composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, erythrocytes and haemosiderin. He was diagnosed with zosteriform lichen aureus and was treated with topical mometasone furoate during 3 weeks resulting in partial lightening of the macules. Lesions have remained 2 years later, and new ones have appeared in the ipsilateral ankle. We must consider differential diagnosis with other pigmented purpuric dermatitis and pigmented purpuric mycosis fungoides. There are many therapeutic options and it tends to disappear spontaneously, so new studies are necessary.",0,990
1183,"BACKGROUND: Gallstone ileus is a non-strangulated mechanical obstruction of the small bowel or colon as a result of the passage of gallstones through a biliary enteric fistula. It is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, affects patients over 65 years, and the disease occurs predominantly in females. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to the lack of specific signs and symptoms in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. CLINICAL CASE: A 93-year-old female presenting with a one-week history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte imbalance and community- acquired pneumonia pneumonia. During her prolonged hospital stay she presented an intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of gallstone ileus was made by CT scan. Despite surgical treatment, she died due to late diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Gallstone ileus is a rare pathology, difficulty in diagnosis prolongs hospital stay, which directly influences mortality.",0,933
1184,"Multiple sclerosis is a major demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It has a significant economic and social impact. Its etiology is unclear, although there are several hypotheses, such as infections or genetics. In its pathophysiology, it seems that immune activation attacks the myelin sheath, causing a progressive and irreversible axonal degeneration. The disease produces a variety of symptoms, and diagnosis requires fulfilling a number of criteria and the exclusion of other possible causes. The role of neuroimaging, especially MRI, is very important. Despite the availability of disease-modifying drugs, none of them are able to halt its progress, and the most useful drugs are those designed to alleviate the symptoms of outbreaks. Overall, multiple sclerosis requires a significant effort in research to clarify not only why and how it occurs, but also to develop of new measures to improve the life of affected patients.",0,947
1185,"Orbitofrontal syndrome is a neuropsychiatric syndrome composed of cognitive, affective and behavioural symptoms, disrupting some of the traits that define us as a species, like cognitive flexibility and affective regulation. In order to effectively treat the condition, the clinician needs to be familiar with both the functional neuroanatomy and the neuropsychiatric semiology of the syndrome. A review of the literature is presented, emphasising the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of the syndrome, together with three clinical vignettes showing the many faces of the syndrome. Several factors influencing the heterogeneity of clinical presentation are discussed. Taking a hierarchical model of neural networks, two core concepts, loss of interoceptive/exteroceptive integration and loss of affective regulation, are proposed in looking for invariants in orbitofrontal syndrome.",0,890
1186,"On 31 May 2013, the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Italy was laboratory confirmed in a previously healthy adult man, who developed pneumonia with moderate respiratory distress after returning from a holiday in Jordan. Two secondary cases were identified through contact tracing, among family members and colleagues who had not previously travelled abroad. Both secondary cases developed mild illness. All three patients recovered fully.",1,488
1187,"Coronary anomalies are mostly asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally during coronary angiography or echocardiography. However, they must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of angina, dyspnea, syncope, acute myocardial infarction or sudden death in young patients. The case is presented of two rare anomalies, single coronary artery originating from right sinus of Valsalva and right aortic arch, in a 65 year-old patient with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease treated percutaneously.",0,507
1188,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious respiratory disease, to the best of our knowledge caused by a hitherto unknown corona virus. The virus has spread from South East Asia to many countries of the world. Three case reports of patients from the Prince of Wales Hospital of The Chinese University of Hong Kong demonstrate typical clinical courses. Fever, cough, in most cases non-productive, myalgia, chills, and rigor are the leading symptoms. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are the most prominent laboratory parameters, increased values for lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) reflect a more severe clinical course. Advanced age and coexisting conditions seem to influence the prognosis unfavourably. The chest roentgenogram may be normal initially but at a later stage progressive consolidations in the majority of peripheral parts of the lung are observed, which cannot be differentiated from pneumonias of other origin. Even young patients can enter a stage of respiratory compromise rather fast. A therapy against the cause of the disease is not known. Empirical therapy with ribavirin in combination with high dose corticosteroids have proved successful. The disease may progress into respiratory failure comparable with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality is around five to ten per cent. Stringent hygiene and quarantine measures are mandatory to prevent the further spread of this threatening disease.",1,1452
1189,"Also known as inflammatory pseudotumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is now considered a true low-grade neoplasm. Although the lung is the most common site, it has been described in many other locations, including the breast; the first report of breast involvement was by Pettinato et al. in 1988. We report the case of a 52-year-old perimenopausal woman presenting with a slow-growing mass in her right breast. Mammography revealed a well demarcated lesion which was hypoechoic on ultrasound. A needle biopsy was performed yielding an initial diagnosis of myofibroma and the mass was resected. Histopathology of the 5-cm tumor revealed a fusocellular proliferation with a striking presence of inflammatory cells, morphologically and immunohistochemically concordant with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The patient underwent further surgery to ensure free margins and after a negative extension study (PET-CT) is receiving no further therapy. To date, she has shown no signs of recurrence 8 months postoperatively. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the breast is very infrequent, with less than 30 reported cases. Differential diagnosis with both benign and malignant entities is extensive and it may precede or coexist with carcinoma of the adjacent breast. Although it is considered a low-malignant potential lesion, there are well documented cases of recurrence and even metastasis. Surgical resection with wide margins is the primary treatment and no systemic therapy is indicated; however, clinical follow-up is mandatory as there are no well-established criteria as yet to predict the biological behavior of this tumor.",0,1640
1190,"Herpesvirus infections are not uncommon in hematologic patients. Our first patient, diagnosed with chronic lymphatic leukemia, presented extensive genital herpes infection refractory to treatment with aciclovir and with a partial response to foscarnet, which had to be withdrawn due to systemic adverse effects. The second patient, diagnosed with follicular Hodgkin lymphoma, presented hypertrophic herpes infection refractory to treatment with aciclovir but that responded to intralesional cidofovir and topical imiquimod. As in other immunocompromised patients, herpesvirus infection in hematologic patients can present atypical manifestations, as well as resistance to treatments that are activated by the viral thymidine kinase. A high level of clinical suspicion is therefore needed to make an early diagnosis, together with extensive knowledge of the different treatments available.",0,888
1191,"This is a case report of a 73-year-old man with new-onset acute renal failure while being investigated for pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. Urine tests showed tubular range proteinuria with no microhaematuria. Immunology tests showed elevated serum IgG and hypocomplementaemia (classical pathway activation). Renal biopsy and clinical-pathological correlation were crucial in this case, reinforcing their important role in the final diagnosis of acute kidney injury.",0,490
1192,"The presence of air inside intracranial cavity is a rare entity known as pneumocephalus and in most cases doesnt present any clinical repercussion except in case of elevated intracranial pressure that can lead to a decreasing level of consciousness, coma and even death. We present a rare case of a young male, without medical precedents of interest, hospitalized in an intensive care unit for vigilance after a traffic accident with asymptomatic crane encephalic trauma and cranial computerized tomography without meaningful findings. During the intensive care unit stay positive pressure is applied in airway with non-invasive mechanical ventilation that produces air entrance in cranial cavity (pneumocephalus) causing neurological deterioration and necessity of urgent surgery.",0,781
1193,"Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes into exocrine glands, resulting in the typical sicca symptoms. Unlike adults, primary SS is a very rare condition in childhood, and the risk of malignancy in juvenile SS (JSS) has not been defined. We report the detection of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (EMZL) occurring in two children with SS. Fine needle aspiration of the salivary glands (SG) showed nonspecific findings that led to delayed diagnosis of SS. The diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma associated with JSS was based on morphologic and immunohistochemical staining done during the biopsy. To highlight awareness of EMZL as a timely and appropriate update of an unusual complication in children with SS.",0,778
1194,"CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old woman who presented with an extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in lacrimal gland and conjunctiva. Initial treatment with rituximab yielded an immediate good response. Five months later she showed lymphoid proliferation in her contralateral conjunctiva. Although no additional treatment was performed, the patient has been free of systemic symptoms and recurrences. DISCUSSION: Rituximab is a quite good therapeutic agent in low grade adnexal lymphomas.",0,485
1195,"INTRODUCTION: Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a skin condition of rare presentation, this disease is characterized by absence of skin at birth and associated with facial, skin and bone skull deformities. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. CASE REPORT: Male 5 days after birth, unique product of primigravida mother and no family history of relevance. Physical examination revealed bilateral and symmetrical skin defects of both lower extremities, the disease is characterized by skin fragility, scabs, and coated pseudomembrane ulcers, decreased interdigital space between toes of the left foot, retraction of the foot and genu varum. It was handled with allograft of epidermis cultured in vitro, general wound care and clinical follow-up. DISCUSSION: ACC associated with epidermolysis bullosa is one of the rarer forms of presentation. It is necessary to rule out other skin diseases. Clinical management is recommended with biological or synthetic skin cover, infection prevention, early treatment of complications and clinical follow.",0,1037
1196,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacobezoars are aggregates of undigested medications that accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause obstructive or toxic complications. In this paper, the first case is reported of a paediatric pharmacobezoar formation after a vitamin overdose. The objective of this report is to prevent the occurrence of this complication and the action to be taken. CLINIC CASE: A 6-year-old child, 6h after ingesting 40 chewable tablets of a hydrophobic vitamin E with high capacity to form a pharmacobezoar, underwent urgent oesophagogastroscopy. A viscoelastic mass of 10x4cm was observed stretching from the cardia to the greater curvature. Seventy-five percent of the mass was removed and the remainder was fragmented, hydrated and aspirated. The patient remains asymptomatic to date. CONCLUSIONS: An overdose of hydrophobic drugs can produce a bezoar formation therefore prompt evacuation is recommended with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a safe and effective technique in gastric bezoars.",0,1026
1197,"Prescription opioids (PO) addiction is increasing to an epidemic level. Few studies exist regarding its treatment. Although buprenorphine has been the mainstay so far, other treatment options might be considered, such as methadone. We conducted a retrospective assessment of all patients admitted to a psychiatry ward for PO detoxification using methadone between 2010 and 2013. The assessment and description was carried out during a 3-month follow-up period after their discharge. Although this is a retrospective chart review, our exploration included sociodemographic and treatment variables in addition to the abstinence rates for the whole sample. Eleven patients were included, mostly women (81.8%), with a median age of 50 years. The median duration of dependence was 8 years. Dependence on other substances and psychiatric comorbidities were high. Eight patients were monitored during three months. Of these, 7 (87.5%) were abstinent after that period. The results suggest that methadone deserves further exploration as a potentially efficacious treatment option for PO dependence.",0,1090
1198,"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired disease that may affect nerve roots and peripheral nerves. Despite its low incidence, diagnosis is particularly important because there are different effective treatments. Human immunoglobulin is one of the mainstays of the treatment. Although there are few studies up to date, subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IgSC) has been proposed as an alternative to intravenous administration with similar efficacy. We present three cases with definite CIDP, classified according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies / Peripheral Nerve, Society (EFNS /PNS) criteria in which was used SCIgG as a treatment after success with the intravenous route. The Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) was used to estimate the changes in the muscular strength before and after treatment.",0,862
1199,"The main clinical manifestation of human herpesvirus 6 is exanthema subitum (also known as roseola infantum) and febrile syndrome. Central nervous system manifestations are not unusual in herpesvirus 6 infection, and even though the pathophysiology is not clear, they need to be early diagnosed and treated in order to avoid potentially serious damage. We present the case of an immunocompetent 2-year-old girl with encephalitis as a complication of herpesvirus 6 infection. We want to emphasize the significance of an early diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent further complications due to the central nervous system extension.",0,635
1200,"Se reporta el proceso de recuperacion y rehabilitacion neurologica y cognitiva de una mujer joven que desarrollo un sindrome de embolia grasa con repercusiones neurologicas, despues de sufrir un politraumatismo. La paciente era una mujer de 21 anos de edad con fractura cerrada de humero y femur izquierdos, que presento un sindrome de embolia grasa, neumotorax izquierdo e hipertension pulmonar, en las primeras 24 horas despues de un accidente. Estuvo hospitalizada un mes y quedo con varios deficits neurologicos centrales, como infartos 'lacunares' y necrosis cortical laminar occipital, asi como limitaciones en la bipedestacion, la marcha, la vision y las funciones cognitivas. A partir del primer mes despues del alta hospitalaria, se comenzo un proceso integral de rehabilitacion neurologica y cognitiva en casa, y posteriormente, en una unidad medica de rehabilitacion. Durante los primeros dos anos despues del accidente, la paciente recibio estimulacion sensorial, sensoperceptiva y motora, asi como rehabilitacion motora y visual intensiva. Una vez se recupero fisicamente, se inicio un proceso de rehabilitacion neuropsicologica. Seis anos despues del accidente, la paciente termino sus estudios universitarios y hoy esta laboralmente activa. El proceso de rehabilitacion neurologica es complejo, individual y dificil, aunque no imposible, y no se puede estandarizar un patron de recuperacion para todos los pacientes. Si bien existe la recuperacion espontanea, la cual se da en los primeros seis meses, el caso aqui reportado demuestra que, en la fase cronica, la recuperacion se puede lograr, pero requiere de evaluaciones y tecnicas coordinadas de rehabilitacion neurologica.",0,1691
1201,"Reports of Lactococcus garvieae infections in humans are scarce, and only one of them in a patient under-going hemodialysis. We report the first case of Lactococcus garvieae infection in Chile, presenting as an infective endocarditis, ultimately fatal, in a patient with uncomplicated colonic diverticulosis and end stage renal failure undergoing chronic hemodialysis. We review the published cases and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with this new, increasingly diagnosed pathogen, capable of producing serious infections in susceptible patients.",0,576
1202,"A description is presented on the management of a patient with an oesophageal neoplasm scheduled for oesophagectomy. Alloantibodies were detected during a blood components reservation procedure, which made it almost impossible to obtain compatible blood.

This strategy has been considered as one of the actions to bear in mind in fast-track surgery or enhanced recovery after surgery.",0,515
1203,"INTRODUCTION: <<Man-in-the-barrel>> syndrome refers to diplegia of the upper extremities in which mobility of the head and lower limbs is preserved. Brachial plexitis that presents as <<man-in-the-barrel>> syndrome is an unusual manifestation of giant cell arteritis. We report a case of C5-C6 plexitis as part of the clinical features of a patient with giant cell arteritis. CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old male with a two-month history of weight loss, headache, facial pain and jaw claudication, associated with a persistent elevation of acute phase reactants and bilateral brachial plexopathy, with no evidence of neck or brain injuries or occult neoplasm and with negative autoimmunity tests. Results of the biopsy study of the temporal artery were compatible with giant cell arteritis, and the positron emission tomography scan revealed extensive vascular involvement of the aorta and its branches. CONCLUSIONS: Although the typical clinical manifestations of giant cell arteritis are headache, jaw claudication, loss of sight, constitutional symptoms and polymyalgia rheumatica, its presence must be suspected in patients over the age of 50 who manifest alterations affecting the peripheral nerve, including brachial diplegia with no other demonstrable cause.",0,1260
1204,"Background: The rupture of the cavernous body (faux pas du coit) refers to the solution of continuity in its surrounding tunica albuginea. It occurs in one of 175,000 hospital admissions, accounting for 58% of penile lesions. When the erect penis flexes abnormally, the abrupt increase in intracavernous pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the tunica albuginea and often determines transverse laceration of the proximal body of the penis. Clinical Case: A 29-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department for an 8-h course of evolution characterized by detumescence, lateral deviation, violet coloration and penile pain, following the introduction of the erect penis into his underwear. The patient was taken as soon as possible to surgical exploration and a 1 x 1 cm continuity solution was repaired in the right corpus cavernosum. Conclusion: The fracture of the penis is a rare disease and a urological emergency. Immediate repair of the rupture of the penis has a low complication rate, shorter hospital stay and better long-term results.",0,1061
1205,"We report a 21 years old woman, without offspring, with diabetes mellitus diagnosed at 17 years of age, without ketosis or weight loss. Her body mass index was 18 kg/m2. Her C peptide was normal (2.3 ng/ml) and diabetes mellitus type 1 autoantibodies were negative. A monogenic diabetes Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) was proposed. Her family study disclosed a diabetic father and a brother with altered fasting glucose levels. The University of Exeter score for MODY yielded a 75.5% probability of MODY2. In the genetic-molecular study of the glucokinase gene (MODY2), the patient had a mutation at position 1343 of exon 10, corresponding to a heterozygous substitution of guanine by adenine (1343 G >A). The same mutation was found in her father and brother. This mutation is different from those previously described in the literature. The described change determines that a glycine is replaced by aspartic at amino acid 448 of the enzyme (non-synonymous substitution). The diagnosis of MODY2 was therefore confirmed in the patient and her father. The mutation was inherited by paternal line.",0,1108
1206,"Gestational alloimmune liver disease, previously known as neonatal hemochromatosis, is characterized by severe liver disease in neonatal period, associated with intra and extrahepatic iron accumulation. It is postulated an alloimmune origin, which has opened new opportunities in the treatment and prevention during risk pregnancies, changing the prognosis of this pathology. We report the case of a newborn that presents early liver failure, with clinical and analytical features compatible with gestational alloimmune liver disease. Exchange transfusion was made and gamma globulins were given, with good clinical evolution.",0,626
1208,"Giant prolactinomas are rare pituitary adenomas characterized by their great local invasion. In this paper, we report a 15-year-old male with left retro-ocular pain and ipsilateral exophthalmos of 4 months of evolution, secondary to a tumour in the base of the skull that invaded the orbit. Hormonal studies revealed serum prolactin of 6913,7 ng/ml (normal value < 20), confirming the diagnosis of giant prolactinoma. The patient started treatment with the dopaminergic agonist cabergoline in increasing doses. After 7 months of follow-up the prolactin had decreased to 349.8 ng/ml and the tumor volume was reduced by 70%, without presenting adverse effects to the treatment. The patient was asymptomatic and had restarted puberty. The rapid remission of symptoms without the need for invasive treatments underlines the importance of considering the diagnosis of prolactinoma among the possible differential diagnoses of tumor of the skull base.",0,945
1209,"Myofibroblastic tumor (MIT) is characterized by the infiltration of different organs, most commonly the lungs, with nodular lesions composed of myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells, which can be identified by specific patterns in the immunohistochemical studies. When it involves the peritoneum it is difficult to eradicate, tends to relapse and it has an invasive behavior, requiring its differentiation from peritoneal carcinomatosis. Treatment may be surgical excision, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids. We report a 30 years old female with an unremarkable medical history, presenting with abdominal pain and progressive abdominal distention. A CT scan revealed multiple peritoneal nodular lesions. A surgical biopsy was reported as a myofibroblast and inflammatory cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemical staining was consistent with MIT. Given the extensive involvement of the peritoneum surgical therapy was not considered appropriate and treatment with NSAID and glucocorticoids was started. No response was observed after 6 months, therefore infliximab therapy was started. After 10 months of follow-up the patient is well, returned to normal life, ascites improved and resolved and CT scan showed partial regression or stabilization of the lesions.",0,1300
1210,"OBJECTIVES: Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome (HWW) is a rare congenital anomaly difficult to diagnose due to an alteration in the common embryological development of the reproductive and urinary tract, with renal agenesis, double collecting system, renal duplication and horseshoe kidney as urologic abnormalities. Due to its rarity and associated urological alterations, we believe that the urologist should be aware of this syndrome because of its implications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the case of an 18-year-old patient with acute retention of urine associated with Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlinch syndrome. We describe this syndrome after a bibliographic search. RESULTS: In our case, the initial clinical course was exclusively urological, with the presentation of voiding bladder dysfunction with subsequent acute retention of urine. Surgical treatment resolved the patient's initial complication. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, as in others, nonspecific and variable symptoms may delay the diagnosis, which may lead to late complications such as endometriosis, adhesion syndrome, collections and infertility. Treatment suppresses pain, improves reproductive capacity and prevents late complications.",0,1206
1211,"Phyllomedusa bicolor or Kambo is a frog that lives in the Amazon rainforest. It can release through its skin a substance used in healing rituals that are common among South-American tribes, as well as in urban people of America and Europe. We report a 41-year-old female patient who, during a healing ritual consumed ayahuasca (a drink obtained from the mixture of Banisteriopsis caapi, Psychotria viridis and Mimosa hostilis) and 12 hours later received the poison of Kambo Frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor) on superficial right shoulder skin burns. The ritual included a minimum of six-liter water intake over a few hours period. She evolved with clouding of sensorium, motor agitation, frequent vomiting, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She presented lethargic to the emergency room, with a weak pupillary light reflex, generalized stiffness, moving all four limbs. Laboratory showed severe hyponatremia (120 mEq/L) and a creatine kinase level of 8,479 UI/L, that increased 107,216 IU/L within few days. An admission CT Brain scan was normal. The toxicological screening did not identify the presence of other substances. During hospitalization the patient developed severe psychomotor agitation controlled by a dexmedetomidine infusion, hyponatremia, low plasma osmolality (248 mOsm/kg), and disproportionately high urinary osmolality (448 mOsm/kg), suggestive of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion syndrome (SIADH). With correction of hyponatremia, the patient gradually recovered consciousness. Rhabdomyolysis was assumed to be secondary to seizure and managed by volume and bicarbonate infusions with a positive response.",0,1639
1212,"Ceftazidime is an antibiotic belonging to the group of third generation cephalosporins, frequently used in clinical practice for its broad antibacterial spectrum. A case report is presented on a 78-year-old man who entered the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure secondary to nosocomial pneumonia in the postoperative period of a laparoscopic hepatic bisegmentectomy for a hepatocarcinoma. It required invasive mechanical ventilation and was treated with ceftazidime, developing a progressive decrease in platelet count after the onset of this drug and after re-exposure to it, not coinciding with the introduction of other drugs. The adverse reaction was reported to the Spanish pharmacosurveillance system and according to the Naranjo algorithm the causal relationship was probable. Since no case of ceftazidime-induced thrombocytopenia was found in the literature, we consider knowledge of it relevant as an adverse effect to be taken into account given its potential severity, especially when it cannot be explained by other causes.",0,1047
1213,"Idiopathic endocranial hypertension is infrequently associated with hypovitaminosis A and D. The case of an 8-year-old female with 24-hour blurred vision and bilateral papilledema is presented. Nuclear magnetic resonance was normal. Opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid: 260 mmH2O. She presented vitamin A and D deficiency and started replacement therapy. The second case corresponds to a 12-year-old male with fever and odynophagia of 3 days. History of glomerulonephritis and overweight. He had bipalpebral edema and papilledema. Computed tomography scan of the orbit: increase of fluid in the sheath of both optic nerves. Nuclear magnetic resonance: intrasellar arachnoidocele. Opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid: 400 mmH2O. He presented vitamin D and B6 deficiency and started replacement treatment. The elevation of intracranial pressure triggers compensation mechanisms that, when they fail, can compromise life or cause serious neurological disabilities.

1214,"INTRODUCTION: Schwannomas are benign tumours that are relatively common in the head, however the involvement of the sinunasal region is rare and there are only 5 cases reported in the maxilla in current literature, representing less than 1% of bone tumours. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a woman with a right maxillary schwannoma who underwent a complete resection of the lesion. Emphasis is placed on the rarity of the lesion in terms of its location and includes a review of clinical behaviour, diagnosis and current treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: Maxillary trigeminal schwannoma must be suspected if vague sinunasal symptoms, paranasal mass or, as in this case, trigeminal neuralgia present. Surgical treatment is indicated, and approaches vary according to location and tumour size.",0,794
1215,"CASE REPORT: The case concerns a 16 year-old boy with a history of high myopia and unilateral congenital cataract, tall stature for age, facial dysmorphism, hypermobile metacarpal-phalangeal joints, as well as behavioural problems. The mother had a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. Chromosomal analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes reported 47,XYY. DISCUSSION: Patients with sex chromosome aneuploidy 47,XYY have higher risk of congenital malformations, although ophthalmological anomalies are unusual. Evaluation of patients with tall stature and behavioural problems should include a chromosomal analysis in order to determine the aetiology.",0,654
1216,"Male of 52 year old with chronic alcoholism and ulcerated lesion on the face and disseminated nodular skin lesions, underwent to biopsy of ulcer edges where was observed a concomitant epidermoid malignancy with Leishmania (L.). Besides others, biopsies of nodule in the periumbilical region, lymph node and bone marrow were assayed, and all biopsies had abundant amastigotes. The amplified Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products from nodule were sequenced and the alignment analysis demonstrated homology with L. mexicana confirming the infection by this parasite. This is considered the first case of visceral and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis concurrent with epidermoid cancer in the state of Campeche.",0,708
1217,"Renal artery stenosis represents a rare cause of neonatal arterial hypertension of renovascular origin, having been described few cases in the literature at this stage of life. Most patients with this disease remain asymptomatic; hypertension can be detected in routine pediatric revisions. Diagnosis can be performed by combining biochemical and radiological findings. The initial management consists of pharmacological therapy in order to achieve adequate growth. Subsequently, it is necessary to assess definitive repair of the vascular lesion or nephrectomy in the case of functional abolition of the affected kidney. We present a term newborn female, with arterial hypertension and an important congestive heart failure, caused by a unilateral renal artery stenosis, with functional abolition and atrophy of the affected kidney, which required an important inotropic and antihypertensive support during her first days of life, with significant clinical improvement subsequently.",0,983
1218,"Horner's syndrome (HS) occurs when there is disruption to the oculosympathetic pathway. Its features include eyelid ptosis, miosis and anhidrosis. The aetiology of this syndrome is varied and includes tumours, trauma, vascular disease and iatrogenic. Different pharmacologic tests are used for diagnosis, such as cocaine, hydroxyamphetamine and apraclonidine; while neuroimaging helps elucidating the aetiology. We present a case of a 63-year-old female referred to our service with a 4-month history of right eyelid ptosis. During examination right miosis was noted. The patient reported a history of multinodular goiter. Pharmacologic tests and neuroimaging confirmed the diagnosis of HS secondary to thyroid disease.",0,719
1219,"CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman who, during a scuba dive at 7 metres, suffered from eye pain, hyperaemia, and exophthalmos. She was diagnosed with ocular barotrauma with transient diplopia. She was seen in the emergency room 10 days later, with no diplopia, but mild left proptosis. In the computed tomography an image of extraconal occupation is observed in the left orbital roof. The magnetic resonance confirmed an intraorbital haematoma. DISCUSSION: Ocular barotrauma is usually a benign condition mostly occurring in an inexperienced diver. However, a detailed examination is important to rule out potential vision and life threatening conditions.",0,653
1220,"Tibialis anterior tendon rupture is a relatively rare injury, with diverse etiologies, that can cause significant deficits in the functionality of the ankle. These injuries are sometimes diagnosed too late, being in many occasions the alteration in walking the symptom that makes the patient go to the doctor. The six weeks will mark the limit between acute and chronic injury, requiring different therapeutic approaches, along with other parameters such as age, functional demand or concomitant pathologies. OBJECTIVE: To present two cases of acute rupture, with different etiology, the surgical technique used and the final results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present two cases of acute rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon in the critical hipovascular area, a male and a female, with posttraumatic and spontaneous etiology, respectively, in which tendon reinsertion was performed on the tarsal scaphoid with a biothenodesis screw, followed by immobilization with permission to walk at three weeks and subsequent physiotherapy. RESULTS: In both cases a satisfactory final functional result was obtained, with a significant improvement in the AOFAS score, returning to their work and sports activities at 3 and 4 months of surgery respectively, with a follow-up of 7.5 years and 10 months. DISCUSSION: This technique, within the variety described in the medical literature, has provided us excellent results, restoring the functionality of the anterior tibialis tendon and being reproducible for its simplicity, providing a high degree of safety when performing an early physiotherapy.",0,1587
1221,"Behcet's disease is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune vasculitis characterized by a triad of key signs. We report the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian girl, who complained of headache, dizziness and paresis of the left side of her body. After physical examination and ancillary tests, she was diagnosed with Behcet's disease with neurological manifestations (neuro-Behcet's disease). She had a good response to treatment. IgG, IgA, IgM and albumin were quantified in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by single radial immunodiffusion. Intrathecal synthesis was found for the 3 classes of immunoglobulins. This is the first case in which the Reibergram was used to evaluate the neuroimmunological response in a patient with Behcet's disease, suggesting the use of this diagnostic means for the active phase of the disease.",0,817
1222,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection emerged in 2012. The majority of cases occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the disease carries a high case fatality rate. METHODS: We present three MERS-CoV cases and highlight the salient clinical features and laboratory, and radiographic characteristics. RESULTS: Although all nasopharyngeal samples were negative, MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the E gene (UpE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on sputum samples. The Ct value of the ORF1 gene was 24.8-29.11. One patient had been on immune suppressive agent and two patients had diabetes mellitus. The average length of hospital stay was 10.6 days. Two patients received ribavirin and IFN-a2b in addition to supportive management. The clinical course for these patients started with a febrile period lasting five days, a reduction in fever was coinciding with increased respiratory rate and oxygen requirements. All patients were discharged home. None of the 50 contacts tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: Resolution of the fever was accompanied by an increase in oxygen requirements and respiratory rate also lasting several days. This was followed by resolution of all symptoms and return to normal.",1,1302
1223,"The fungi of the order Mucorales cause mucormycosis, which usually presents as an invasive fungal disease with rapid angioinvasion in immunocompromised patients. Rhinocerebral is the most common presentation. The lipid formulations of amphotericin B are used as primary treatment in invasive mucormycosis; the combined use of posaconazole could allow a reduction in the dose of amphotericin B improving tolerance and adherence to treatment. Caspofungin and amphotericin B association has been shown to be synergistic in vitro and effective in murine models. We present the case of a preschool patient that during the debut of acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed a rhinocerebral mucormycosis successfully responding to antifungal treatment with the combination of liposomal amphotericin and caspofungin.",0,805
1224,"CLINICAL CASE: A case is presented of an 85-year-old woman living in a geriatric residence, who was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with a spontaneous expulsive choroidal hemorrhage in her left eye. There was no a history of ophthalmic disease, and the patient only reported having intracapsular cataract surgery in both eyes 25 years ago, and that she also became blind in her left eye in the past few years. DISCUSSION: Non-surgical spontaneous expulsive choroidal hemorrhage is a very rare and disastrous clinical event. The predisposing factors involved are: advancing age, vascular illness (especially atherosclerosis), glaucoma, and severe corneal damage.",0,682
1225,"BACKGROUND: Purpureocillium lilacinum eye infections (previously called Paecilomyces lilacinus) make up a significant percentage of the recorded cases of infection by this fungus, and is considered as an emerging pathogen. AIMS: To report a case of ocular mycosis in a patient aged 70, with a double corneal transplantation in the right eye, and exhibiting a poor response to antifungal and surgical treatment. METHODS: Corneal ring and ocular tissues obtained by surgical procedures were cultured in common mycological media. Molecular identification of the isolated fungus was obtained. RESULTS: Colonies of a filamentous fungus were obtained, and according to the macroscopic and microscopic morphology it was identified as P. lilacinum. The identification was confirmed by molecular methods in a reference laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Eye infections due to P. lilacinum are rare but serious diseases that requires rapid diagnostic and therapeutic measures to enable visual function to recover.",0,993

Infection is acquired through wounds on contact with sick animals or carriers, their products or objects contaminated with their waste. We report a 40 years old tannery male worker, presenting in the emergency room with fever lasting one month. An echocardiogram showed a vegetation and perforation of the aortic valve with severe aortic regurgitation. Blood cultures gave growth to E. rhusiopathiae. The patient was treated with penicillin. After three weeks of treatment an aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve was performed. At six weeks, he was discharged from the hospital.",0,701
1227,"Isolated limb perfusion is the treatment of stage III melanoma with in-transit metastasis. This technique allows the administration of cytostatics at an effective concentration and temperature, which could not be administered systemically because of their toxicity. The toxicity due to leakage of the chemotherapy agent from the limb into the systemic circulation is the most serious short-term complication, and is manifested by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the immediate post-intervention period. Early detection of this complication and its peri-operative management requires a multidisciplinary approach, in which the anaesthesiologist plays a key role. A case of isolated lower limb perfusion is reported in which the procedure had to be interrupted due to the passage of tumour necrosis factor into the systemic circulation, with severe intra-operative haemodynamic repercussions.",0,902
1228,"OBJECTIVE: To present methodical approach of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) as an option for an unaffected pregnancy in reproductive-age couples who have a genetic risk of the X-linked dominant peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed PGD of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease using haplotyping/indirect linkage analysis, when during analysis we reach to exclude embryos that carry a high-risk haplotype linked to the causal mutation p.Leu9Phe in the GJB1 gene. RESULTS: Within the PGD cycle, we examined 4 blastomeres biopsied from cleavage-stage embryos and recommended 3 embryos for transfer. Two embryos were implanted into the uterus; however, it resulted in a singleton pregnancy with a male descendant. Three years later, the couple returned again with spontaneous gravidity. A chorionic biopsy examination of this gravidity ascertained the female sex and a pericentric inversion of chromosome 5 in 70% of the cultivated foetal cells. CONCLUSION: Using indirect linkage analysis, PGD may help to identify genetic X-linked defects within embryos during screening, thereby circumventing the potential problems with abortion.",0,1199
1229,"A clinical case is presented that was communicated to Spanish Notification System on Safety in Anaesthesia and Recovery (SENSAR). Using this communication and its analysis, a strategy is obtained in order to reduce the risks associated with the insertion of a nasogastric tube (NST) for enteral nutrition in adult patients in the post-surgical recovery unit. A description of the incident is presented, an analysis of its causes, and the measures that were introduced in order to avoid similar incidents in the future, as well as to promote a safety culture in the organisation.

1231,"INTRODUCTION: Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug whose exact mechanism of action remains unknown. It acts by increasing the slow inactivation of the voltage-dependent sodium channels of the cell membranes. It is indicated in the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation and is occasionally used as adjunct treatment in neuropathic pain. Although the most frequent side effects are mild (dizziness, diplopia, blurred vision, headache, tremor, etc.), others such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, changes in repolarisation, atrioventricular blocks and even cardiac arrest or sudden death have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old male, diagnosed with classic trigeminal neuralgia treated with 200 mg/12 h of carbamazepine, who visited due to a worsening of the pain in the trigeminal V1-V2 region. On the sixth day after admission, after adjusting the carbamazepine treatment to a descending regime, 400 mg/24 h of eslicarbazepine and 100 mg/12 h of intravenous lacosamide, he presented a complete atrioventricular block with extreme bradycardia that required the placement of a pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS: Voltage-dependent sodium channel blockade mainly affects non-sinusal cardiac tissue. An alteration in the atrioventricular or infrahisian node is more consistent with its mechanism of action. Other cases of atrioventricular block in this kind of polytherapy have been reported. Precaution is advised in the concomitant use of antiepileptic drugs, above all among those that prolong the PR interval, and they should be contraindicated in patients with a history of atrioventricular block, ischaemic heart disease or heart failure. Before starting, a baseline electrocardiogram and regular electrocardiographic monitoring are advised during the first few weeks.",0,1798
1232,"INTRODUCTION: Pathologies related to lymphocyte infiltration and inflammatory cells are classified, according to their topography, into idiopathic orbital pathology, idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome and lymphocytic hypophysitis. Here we review the case of a female patient who began with lymphocytic hypophysitis eight years ago and has since presented several episodes of hypertrophic pachymeningitis in a variety of locations. CASE REPORT: Our study involves a 55-year-old female, being monitored owing to a two-month history of headaches, who was admitted to hospital as the result of a deterioration of her clinical signs and symptoms with paralysis of the whole right-side third cranial nerve, watery eyes and rhinorrhea. A magnetic resonance brain scan revealed the presence of a sellar lesion consistent with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Treatment was established with corticoids with an improvement at first, but two years later the patient's clinical features worsened, with headaches and periocular paraesthesias on the right-hand side. Another MRI scan was performed and several extra-axial lesions were observed, the results of the other studies being normal. Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis was therefore diagnosed and treatment with corticoids was started again. In the ensuing follow-up the patient presented new lesions in different locations and poor pain control, and so immunomodulator treatment was thus added. Given the association between lymphocytic hypophysitis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis, the study was completed with determination of the IgG4 in serum, which was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The association of lymphocytic hypophysitis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis with IgG4-related pathologies have recently been reported. Although the diagnosis has not been confirmed in our patient, this relationship must be taken into account in these idiopathic cases and, above all, if they are associated with other systemic manifestations.",0,1995
1233,"There is a relationship between thyroid diseases and primary and secondary changes in haemostasis. The most frequent association between them are hypocoagulability states with clinical hypothyroidism and vascular thrombophilia (hypercoagulability and/or hypofibrinolysis) with hyperparathyroidism. However, there are recent studies that have detected changes in haemostasis -primary and secondary- associated with thyroid diseases with normal hormone levels, suggesting other pathogenic mechanisms not yet known. The cases are presented of 2 patients with thyroid disease that required surgery: one multinodular goitre and one papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, both with normal hormone levels. They were shown to have haemostasis disorders during the preoperative work up. These showed a Factor VII deficiency and a Factor XI deficiency along with a thrombotic disease of unknown origin, respectively.",0,903

1235,"BACKGROUND: Pylephlebitis or septic thrombophlebitis of the portal venous system is a rare but serious complication of intra-abdominal infections which drain into the portal venous system. Its diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and imaging tests, mainly a computed tomography scan, given the lack of specificity of the signs and symptoms. Spread of septic emboli is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to analyse patients diagnosed in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with pylephlebitis in our hospital. CLINICAL CASES: Four patients were included, 3 men and one woman. In 3 cases it was acute cholecystitis that led to the diagnosis of pylephlebitis at the same time as the intra-abdominal infection. Emergency surgery was performed in one case, whilst the other 2 were treated conservatively. Blood cultures were performed in all cases, and empirical antibiotic treatment was used. In the only case of acute appendicitis, diagnosis of pylephlebitis was achieved during the study of postoperative fever, with empirical antibiotic treatment also being started. The haematologist was requested to start the required anticoagulation therapy in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Pylephlebitis is a rare complication of intra-abdominal infections that may make lead to a worse outcome. A high level of suspicion is required as well as imaging tests to make an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",0,1484
1236,Gougerot and Carteaud confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP) is an uncommon dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented scaly macules or papillomatous papules coalescing into confluent patches or plaques centrally with a reticular pattern peripherally. We report a 28-year-old woman presenting at 16 weeks of gestation with an itchy rash that was biopsied and turned out to be consistent with CARP. Options for treatment were discussed but the woman refused to take any systemic therapy and used only moisturizers throughout her pregnancy. The rash subsided spontaneously after delivery.,0,595
1237,"Embolic stroke secondary to cardiac tumors is uncommon. However, 25-30% of cardiac tumors may cause systemic emboli. We report a 29-year-old male consulting for a sudden episode of aphasia and right hemiparesis, compatible with infarct of the left middle cerebral artery territory. Transthoracic echocardiography reported an ovoid tumor of 8 x 7 x 7 mm in relation to the sub valvular apparatus of the mitral valve. After neurologic stabilization, surgical treatment was performed. Approached by median sternotomy and in cardiopulmonary bypass, the mitral valve was explored. A macroscopic tumor consistent with a papillary fibroelastoma curled in sub valvular chordae was found. It was deployed and resected from its base, while the anterior mitral leaflet was preserved intact. Histopathological examination confirmed the intraoperative macroscopic diagnosis. The patient recovered uneventfully postoperatively and was discharged on the fifth day after surgery.

Spontaneous intestinal perforation is a recently defined clinical entity. The best-known risk factor is prematurity. It is seen 2-3% in very low birthweight infants and 5 % of extremely low birthweight infants. Herein we report an extremely low birthweight infant with spontaneous intestinal perforation, segmental absence of intestinal muscle and an ileal web as an underlying cause. We aimed to draw attention to the segmental absence of intestinal muscle which is rare but increasingly reported cause of spontaneous intestinal perforation and the importance of histopathologic examination of surgical specimens.",0,782

1249,"Gnathostomiasis is an emerging disease in non-endemic countries. This zoonotic nematode requires aquatic freshwater environments to complete its life cycle where larvae get encrusted in fishes. Typically, the infection manifests as migratory subcutaneous lesion caused by the larvae trak, which produces an eosinophilic panniculitis. Here we describe a patient who presented a migratory lesion with no response to antimicrobial therapy, a careful travel and food history together with specific laboratory tests led to the correct diagnosis. Gnathostomiasis should be suspected in patients with migratory skin lesions who have consumed raw freshwater fish during travel to endemic countries in South America or Asia.",0,715
1250,"Klippel-Feil Syndrome is a disease characterised by congenital fusion of cervical vertebra, which leads to cervical limitation and instability. In these cases, the best option is the orotracheal intubation with the fibre-optic bronchoscope with the patient awake. The advantage is that cervical movements that could lead to neurological damage are minimised. In these patients, adequate sedation, together with instillation of local anaesthetic in the pharynx and hypopharynx, is the key to reducing patient discomfort and achieving successful orotracheal intubation. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha2- adrenergic receptor agonist that produces sedation and analgesia at the locus coeruleus without producing respiratory depression, as well as maintaining patient collaboration.

1252,"INTRODUCTION: Few reports are available about perinatal dengue, with controversial results in regards the risk of perinatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of perinatal dengue as a differential diagno sis with neonatal sepsis, which must be considered in endemic areas. CLINICAL CASE: Male newborn of a 23 year-old female, who presented a Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) antigen positive to dengue at 36 weeks of gestation and negative anti-dengue antibodies. At day six of the illness a healthy newborn was born. On the second day of life the neonate presented fever with no other pathological findings on the physical exam, associated with severe thrombocytopenia (17,900 platelets/uL), increased C-reactive protein, a positive NS1 antigen, and positive anti-dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG). He was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin according the Institution protocol of neonatal sepsis. The newborn showed clinical improvement, with hemodynamic stability and significant increase of platelets, receiving the medical discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue in pregnancy produces the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly low birth weight and preterm delivery. Children of mothers diagnosed with dengue at the end of pregnancy should be observed closely with serial hemograms during child's first days of life, due to the high risk of vertical transmission.",0,1367

We report an exceptional case of a five-week-old T12-L1 spine dislocation in a 25-year-old female with complete paraplegia as a result of trauma in Ciudad de Leon (Nicaragua). In view of the time since the dislocation, we performed a complete L1 vertebrectomy in order to reduce the dorsolumbar hinge. For osteosynthesis material we had only eight screws and two Steffee plates. We therefore introduced pedicle screws at levels T11, T12, L2 and L3 on the right side and T11, T12, L3 and L4 on the left, and performed manual reduction of the spine. Steffee plates were placed and we added sublaminar wires to reinforce the osteosynthesis. Fifteen months after surgery, there has been no neurological improvement.",0,873

1255,"BACKGROUND: Ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the distal ureteral segment. The incidence in women ranges from 1/5,000 to 1/12,000. In adults, they are poorly diagnosed and are asymptomatic. Prolapse through the urethra is uncommon, and involves acute urine retention and a reducible vulvar tumour. CLINICAL CASE: Woman of 24 years old, two previous caesarean and two abortions. She had incomplete bladder emptying, intermittent voiding, bladder straining and tenesmus, three months before admission. After the voiding effort she presented with acute urine retention with sudden onset of tumour in the vulva. The tumour was manually reduced under regional anaesthesia. A cystoscopy was performed, finding an ischaemic de-roofing of the anterior wall of the ureterocele, causing vesicoureteral reflux grade IV. Surgical correction was performed with Cohen re-implantation and insertion of a double-J catheter. The catheter was removed 30 days later, with a successful post-operative course. DISCUSSION: Its aetiology is unclear, and most are diagnosed by ultrasound in the prenatal period. The clinical presentation is variable, from urinary tract infection to prolapse. Despite its size, it may cause complications such as ischaemic de-roofing, which if diagnosed soon may be resolved successfully, as with this patient. CONCLUSION: The results and treatment may be favourable when no renal impact or concomitant anatomical changes are present, as is the case of this patient.",0,1477

An MRI showed no criteria in favour of a hepatocarcinoma, however, the rapid growth lead to a biopsy of both the lesion and the cirrhotic liver. The pathology results indicated normal development of the bile ducts in the mass and paucity of the biliary ducts in the second liver specimen. We will describe this case and propose an interpretation of these findings.",0,611
1257,Viral myositis associated with infections rarely may cause rhabdomyolysis. There is no any pediatric case with severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections in the literature. We reported a two-year-old boy who was hospitalized three times due to severe rhabdomyolysis associated with viral myositis in the winter months. This is the first child case presentation with severe rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections. Prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin treatments were ineffective in this case.,0,511
1258,"Antecedentes: El carcinoma folicular de tiroides puede producir metastasis a distancia, siendo las localizaciones mas habituales el pulmon y el hueso. Las metastasis cerebrales son inusuales, y es poco habitual que aparezcan como primera manifestacion de cancer. Caso clinico: Paciente varon de 80 anos, que tras una caida al suelo comenzo con alteracion del comportamiento, desorientacion y perdida del control de esfinteres. La tomografia computarizada cerebral evidencio una masa en el lobulo frontal derecho. Se realizo la extirpacion de la lesion cerebral, cuyo estudio histologico informo de metastasis de carcinoma folicular de tiroides. Conclusion: La manifestacion de la enfermedad con metastasis cerebrales es muy infrecuente, y empeora el pronostico notablemente. Background: Follicular thyroid carcinoma can produce distant metastases, generally occur to lung followed by bone. Brain metastases are unusual, and onset manifestation is little frequently. Clinical case: A 80-years old men presented disturbance behavior, desorientation and loss of sphincters after fallin to the ground. Computed tomography scan showed a lesion in the right frontal lobe. The patient underwent a craniotomy to remove the brain tumor, histopathology confirmed of follicular thyroid carcinoma metastases. Conclusion: At initial diagnosis brain metastasis are extremely rare, with adverse prognosis.",0,1390
1259,"Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic infection, caused by pigmented fungi affecting skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by verrucous nodules or plaques. Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Cladophialophora carrionii are the prevalent agents in the endemic areas. Phoma is an uncommon agent of human infection and involved mainly with phaeohyphomycosis cases. The case of a patient with a history of laceration in foot followed by verrucous aspect and scaly lesions, which had evolved for 27 years is presented. On physical examination disease was clinically compatible with chromoblastomycosis and the microscopic examination of scales showed fumagoid cells. On culture a dematiaceous fungus was grown. The agent was confirmed to be Phoma insulana based on its morphology and PCR-sequencing. This fungal agent has not been previously reported in association with this pathology.",0,869
1260,"Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon neoplastic disease of endothelial origin, with an incidence inferior to one in a million. It usually behaves as a low-grade malignancy; nevertheless, a few cases have been described in which this tumour manifests a highly aggressive behavior, spreading throughout the organism.

McArdle disease is the most common disorder of skeletal muscle carbohydrate metabolism. The cases are presented on 2 patients who were referred to our medical consultation to study the cause of their increased CK levels: a 72 year old asymptomatic man with high levels of CK detected by chance in a routine analysis, and a 30 year old woman with very few symptoms, apart from slight muscle pain and tiredness. Electromyography was normal in both patients. There was null activity of myophosphorylase in muscle biopsy of both cases, so a diagnosis of McArdle disease was made.",0,735
1262,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 39-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib. She presented with a severe acute panuveitis with granulomatous anterior uveitis, vitritis, and multiple serous retinal detachments. Dabrafenib and trametinib were suspended, and treatment with a systemic and topical corticosteroid was started. A good response was obtained, with a recovery of visual acuity of 1.0 in both eyes within two weeks. DISCUSSION: Dabrafenib and trametinib can lead to severe uveitis. Treatment with corticosteroids and discontinuation of therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib led to an anatomical and functional improvement, and resolved the episode rapidly. Ophthalmologists must be aware of this toxicity, given the increasing use of those drugs.",0,800
1263,"We report the case of a 29-year-old epileptic woman who had been on treatment with topiramate 25mg/day for 9 days. She was referred to the Emergency Department due to reduction in far visual acuity (VA) after increasing the dose to 50mg/day two days before. The ocular examination showed bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) and macular striae in both eyes (AO) observed by Retinography and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The AACG is a well-known side effect of topiramate, but the macular striae rarely accompanies it. Although macular striae have been previously described in other cases, very few document those using retinography and OCT images. Therefore, it is important to differentiate a case of AACG induced by topiramate from a case of primary AACG, since they differ in their clinical presentation, mechanism of action, and treatment. Mismanagement can have potentially serious consequences.",0,916

He was treated with caspofungin and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in stead of surgical intervention.",0,790
1269,"INTRODUCTION: Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-6 is a rare and early onset neurodegenerative disease which entails a clinical pattern of pyramidal-extrapyramidal and cerebellar involvement and it comes with a neuroimaging consisting of hypomielination, cerebellar hypoplasia and specific abnormalities in basal ganglia, particularly the absence or nearly absence of putamen and the possible loss of caudate's volume. It is due to an alteration in tubulin and it is determined by mutations in heterocygosis in TUBB4A gene, showing complete penetrance. CASE REPORT: An 8-year-old child with history of delayed motor development, tremor, dysathria, ataxia, nystagmus, cognitive deficit and dystonia with pattern of hypomielination, vermis hypoplasia and absence of putamen. These findings, although distinctive, had been underestimated in previous evaluations and their detection determined the analyse and identification of a pathogenic variant in TUBB4A gene. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive deterioration leads the patient to total dependence or death in infancy or youth and there is no specific treatment capable of modifying its natural course.",0,1138
1270,"Spindle cell oncocytoma is an infrequent benign non-endocrine sellar neoplasm. Due to its similar morphology to pituitary adenomas, consideration of this differential diagnosis would conduce to a more careful surgical approach in order to avoid intraoperative bleeding and aiming to a complete resection, on which depends long-term outcomes. We present the case of a 60-year-old male who complained about visual abnormalities, with computerized visual field confirmation. On biochemistry, a panhypopituitarism was detected. The brain magnetic resonance images showed a sellar mass. A non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma was presumptively diagnosed and due to the visual impairment, surgical transesphenoidal treatment was indicated. The histological diagnosis was spindle cell oncocytoma. Five months after surgery, the control image demonstrated a lesion that was considered as remnant tumor, hence radiosurgery was performed. During the follow-up, the tumor reduced its size and four years after initial treatment, the sellar resonance imaging showed disappearance of the residual tumor. Communication of new cases of this rare entity will enlarge the existing evidence and will help to determinate the most effective treatment and prognosis.",0,1247
1271,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a very rare disease, of unknown origin that affects primarily the metaphysis of long bones. It is characterized by an insidious onset of symptoms and multiple remissions. The chronicity of symptoms, the diagnostic imaging and the lack of response to first line antibiotic treatment, should be helpful for diagnostic. OBJECTIVE: Present a clinical case, based on clinical, laboratory, radiologic imaging and histopathological results, that ultimately led to the diagnostic of CRMO. CASE REPORT: 9 year old, female patient, with one month of bilateral knee and left ankle arthralgia. Bone Gammagraphy and full body MRI, showed multifocal bone inflammation. These findings led to a biopsy, that turned negative for malignancy and infection. Given all the information available from the laboratory test results, radiologic imaging and histopathological findings, CRMO diagnosis was made. NSAID treatment was order, with good results. CONCLUSIONS: CRMO is a rare disease that even to date and with cutting edge technology, still represents a diagnostic challenge that primarily relies on a high level of suspicion, for a timely and correct treatment.",0,1212
1272,"The cardiorenal syndrome has been defined as a situation in which therapy to relieve congestive symptoms of heart failure is limited by a decreased renal function. The resistance to conventional diuretic treatment makes difficult managing these patients. Tolvaptan, a selective vasopressin-2 receptor antagonist, has been used successfully in adults with this pathology but the experience with children is very limited. A five-year-old girl with renal failure waiting for a heart transplant is presented. Tolvaptan (0.1 mg/kg/day) was started at very low dosage, resulting in an excellent response. We analyzed the creatinine, urea, urine volume and sodium evolution. Renal function also improved. She could be discharged after four days of treatment (156 days of hospitalization) with ambulatory favourable follow-up until heart transplant. Tolvaptan should be considered in pediatric cases of conventional diuretic-resistant congestive heart failure, especially when complicated by kidney disease.",0,999
1273,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation in patients with liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, and cavernous transformation of the portal vein, is a complex procedure with high possibility of liver graft dysfunction. It is performed in 2-19% of all liver transplants, and has a significantly high mortality rate in the post-operative period. Other procedures to maintain portal perfusion have been described, however there are no reports of liver graft perfusion using right gastroepiploic vein. CLINICAL CASE: A 20 year-old female diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis, with a Child-Pugh score of 7 points (class ""B""), and MELD score of 14 points, with thrombosis and cavernous transformation of the portal vein, severe portal hypertension, splenomegaly, a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to oesophageal varices, and left renal agenesis. The preoperative evaluation for liver transplantation was completed, and the right gastroepiploic vein of 1-cm diameter was observed draining to the infrahepatic inferior vena cava and right suprarenal vein. An orthotopic liver transplantation was performed from a non-living donor (deceased on January 30, 2005) using the Piggy-Back technique. Portal vein perfusion was maintained using the right gastroepiploic vein, and the outcome was satisfactory. The patient was discharged 13 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation was performed satisfactorily, obtaining an acceptable outcome. In this case, the portal perfusion had adequate blood flow through the right gastroepiploic vein.",0,1548
1274,"CLINICAL CASES: The cases are presented on 2 female patients with Straatsma syndrome, with satisfactory treatment of amblyopia. DISCUSSION: The level of anisometropia and myelination of retinal nerve fibres were different in these two patients. However, both achieved 0.20 (logMAR) visual acuity with correction in both eyes following amblyopia treatment with ocular patching. Visual prognosis of amblyopia associated with myelination of retinal nerve fibres and anisometropia is poorer than anisometropic amblyopia without myelination. It is well known that the former is refractory to occlusive therapy. Despite having a poor prognosis, visual rehabilitation should be attempted. The two cases presented were successfully treated with eye-patching.",0,750
1275,"In daily clinical practice, the dermatologic surgeon frequently has to excise closely adjacent tumors in the facial region. In such cases, planning of an appropriate reconstruction technique is essential.

We present 5 patients in whom a single flap was used to repair multiple adjacent defects.",0,436
1276,"Urinary leakage in patients with kidney transplantation is a relatively common surgical complication that requires early diagnosis and intervention. The isotopic renogram is a non-invasive and effective method to evaluate the perfusion and function of kidney transplantation, and allows us to diagnose urological complications such as urinary leakage. In these cases, it is useful to complete the study with planar images and delayed SPECT/CT to specify the diagnosis and locate the leak. We expose two cases diagnosed with urinary leak after performing a renogram with early and delayed planar images and delayed SPECT/CT a week after transplantation. In both cases, a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter was placed, as well as a double J catheter, resolving the surgical complication.",0,784
1277,"INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic granulomatose infection, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GP) is a small vessel vasculitis, both of which affect the lungs. The combination of these diseases is rare. Both have similar clinical features, making the differential diagnosis difficult. CASE REPORT: It concerns a 37 year-old female undergoing treatment for pulmonary TB, who presented with left ocular proptosis, eyelid and conjunctival edema and erythema. Orbital biopsy revealed GP. C-Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were elevated. The patient responded well to immunosuppressive treatment. CONCLUSION: TB and GP can associate. Diagnosis should include not only C-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, but also a biopsy, in order to select the appropriate treatment.",0,790
1278,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case report is to describe the anesthetic management in a child with moya-moya disease and sickle cell anemia provided in a tertiary hospital. CASE: A 6 year-old patient, diagnosed with moya-moya disease and sickle cell anemia, both conditions associated with a greater incidence of intracranial ischemic events, with a history of two strokes of the ischemic subtype, was submitted to general anesthesia for the execution of multiple cranial burr holes in order to produce the neovascularization in poorly perfused regions. There were no complications in the perioperative period and the child was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Although scarcely described in the medical literature, the anesthetic management in a patient with moya-moya disease must ensure the maintenance of cerebral blood flow, normocapnia and the appropriate mean arterial pressure. In a patient with sickle cell disease, an adequate tissue perfusion, adequate oxygenation and hydration and strict pain control are to be primarily expected. The anesthesiologist is expected to know the physiopathology of both conditions to provide the best outcome for these patients.",0,1215
1279,"Atypical odontalgia (AO) is defined as a continuous dental pain in the area of one or several teeth, sometimes preceded by dental procedures in the absence of signs of dental pathology after complete examination. It is thought to have a neuropathic origin in which the response to local and systemic treatment is insufficient. We present the case of a 50-year-old patient with AO after dental extraction, who presented a significant reduction in pain after local treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA (OnabotA) in the symptomatic area. The response to the administration of OnabotA in this patient is in line with what had previously been observed in small series of cases, so it could be a therapeutic alternative in this type of pain that is difficult to control.",0,761
1280,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial noncompaction of the left ventricle is a congenital cardiomyopathy characterised by left ventricular hypertrabeculation and prominent intertrabecular recesses. The incidence ranges from 0.15% to 2.2%. Clinical manifestations include heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Prognosis is fatal in most cases. Heart transplantation is a therapeutic option for this cardiomyopathy, and few had been made worldwide. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 20 year-old male with noncompacted myocardium of the left ventricle, who had clinical signs of heart failure. His functional class was IV on the New York Heart Association scale. He was successfully transplanted. Its survival to 15 months is optimal in class I New York Heart Association, and endomyocardial biopsies have been reported without evidence of acute rejection. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that heart transplantation modified the natural history and improved survival in patients with this congenital heart disease.",0,1002
1281,"Thromboembolic disease in newborn infants is a serious problem. The most important risk factors are iatrogenic factors, including indwelling umbilical catheters or central catheters. Other risk factors include asphyxia, dehydration, sepsis, cardiac disease, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation, congenital thrombophilia (i.e., protein C or protein S deficiency), maternal diabetes mellitus, and passive transfer of maternal antiphospholipid antibodies. Neonates are more vulnerable to thrombosis than adults due to their reduced fibrinolytic capability. We describe a case of a 1-day-old female newborn with arterial thromboembolism in the lower leg without a central line catheter. The thromboembolismin in this case was associated with RDS. The infant underwent thrombolysis, anticoagulation therapy, and surgical thrombectomy. The leg of the infant was subsequently amputated below the knee. The case is described here with a brief review of relevant literatures.",0,1006
1282,"Spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon pathology. It has an incidence of one case per 100 000 individuals. An increase is observed due to the raise of risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, spinal abnormalities, tattoos, acupuncture, epidural analgesia, and a greater availability of imaging methods. It is a purulent collection located between the dura and the medullary canal. The most common germs are Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Without timely treatment, it evolves to medullary compression and permanent neurological sequelae. An 11-year-old girl was admitted with fever of 48 hs evolution, left lower back pain, antalgic gait with lumbar stiffness. Neurological examination was normal. Blunt blistering lesions were observed on lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an image compatible with spinal epidural abscess. The evolutionwas favorable. Treatment consisted of surgical drainage and antibiotics for 6 weeks. From the culture of the material obtained, methidllin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated.",0,1051
1283,"BACKGROUND: Even in expert hands, there can be serious complications when performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The most frequent complications are pancreatitis, cholangitis, bleeding, perforation, and acute cholecystitis. The hepatic subcapsular haematoma is a rare complication, with few cases described worldwide. OBJECTIVE: A case is presented of an extremely rare complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which required surgical treatment for its resolution without success. This is second case of mortality reported in the literature. CLINICAL CASE: Female patient of 30 years old, with indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to benign strictures. A hydro-pneumatic dilation and stent placement of 2 gauge 10 fr was performed. She presented abdominal pain after the procedure and significant decline in haemoglobin with no evidence of haemodynamic instability so an abdominal tomography scan was performed, showing no evidence of liver injury. The patient was haemodynamic unstable within 72 h. A laparotomy was required for damage control, with fatal outcome in the intensive care unit due to multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: Subcapsular hepatic haematoma after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a rare complication, with few cases reported in the literature. Treatment described in the literature is conservative, resulting in a satisfactory resolution.",0,1454
1284,"INTRODUCTION: Noonan syndrome is the most frequent of the congenital group of malformation syndromes caused by germline mutations that encode components of the RAS/MAPK pathway, termed RASopathies, one of the most frequent congenital genetic disorders in the clinical practice. Recently RIT1 mutations have been reported in patients with Noonan syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 7 years-old girl with a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, and with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy included in her clinical manifestations, where a de novo heterozygous, probably pathogenic, novel mutation in RIT1, c.295T>C (p.Phe99Leu), has been identified. CONCLUSIONS: RIT1 shares homology with other RAS proteins and the expression of mutant alleles demonstrates a gain-of-function effect supporting a causative role in Noonan syndrome pathogenesis. Data suggest that the frequency of RIT1 mutations can be estimated as 3-5% in Noonan syndrome patients. These cases compared with Noonan patients harboring mutations in other genes are characterized by high frequency of prenatal abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and lower frequencies of short stature and pectus abnormalities. We emphasize the importance of the novel identified genes in order to be included in the diagnostic panels.",0,1275
1285,"CASE REPORTS: Three clinical cases are presented of MEK retinopathy associated with the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib characterised by alteration of the retinal pigment epithelium and neurosensory detachment. Two of the cases conserved the vision of the unit, and the third developed a large bilateral neurosensory detachment with final visual acuity of 0.6 for the right eye and 0.1 for the left one.

1289,"One year after the occurrence of the first case of infection by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) there is no clear consensus on the best treatment to propose. The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFNalpha, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFNalpha, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFNgamma that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. We highlight the critical role of IFNalpha in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFNalpha treatment during MERS-CoV infection.",1,1996

Syndrome of Klinefelter is the most common cause of hipergonadotrophic hypogonadism in males. The concomitant presentation of both entities is extremely low (1/109) and the pathophysiological association is questionned. We present the case of a 18-year-old Belgian patient. He had a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma in childhood and he presented with panhypopituitarism after radiotherapy and surgical treatment. At the age of 14, he started pubertal induction with gonadotropin therapy without clinical response.

1292,"INTRODUCTION: Sweet's syndrome is a very rare dermatosis in pediatrics, of unknown pathogenesis, clinically characterized by fever, neutrophilia, raised and painful plaques on the skin of the face, neck, and limbs, and histologically by dermal infiltration of neutrophils. OBJECTIVE: To present a clinical case of Sweet Syndrome in a pediatric patient. CLINICAL CASE: 3-years-old female child, with history of complex chromosomopathy 46XX add(8), with a 7-day history of plaques and blisters on the back and later also on the limbs, associated with high fever, without response to antibiotic treatment pres cribed due to suspicion of bullous impetigo. Physical examination showed multiple erythematous- violaceous plaques, with bullous center on the back, upper and lower limbs, along with plaques and erythematous nodules on the left arm and thigh. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutro philia (absolute neutrophil count 45954/mm3) and elevated CRP (347 mg/L). Biopsy of skin lesions reported histopathological findings compatible with Sweet's Syndrome. Treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day was indicated with good clinical response. After two weeks of treatment, she presented crusty plaques of smaller size, without bullous lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome is an uncom mon dermatosis in pediatrics, therefore, a high index of suspicion should be held in the presence of fever associated with persistent skin lesions. While most cases are idiopathic, screening for associated conditions, mainly proliferative disorders, infections, and immunodeficiencies must be performed.",0,1593
1293,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as fever over 7 to 10 days without a diagnosis despite a complete initial study. The most frequent causes are infections, autoimmune and tumors. Even though most cases are self-limited there is a minority that has an underlying etiology with an ominous forecast, encouraging a systematized study. OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of a boy who presented fever of unknown origin associated to panniculitis and was diagnosed of subcutaneous panniculitis-like-T cell lymphoma and to emphasis the importance of a sequential study of FUO, in order to reach a diagnosis in patients who need a timely intervention. CLINICAL CASE: A ten year old boy, previously healthy, presented subcutaneous nodular lesions of 2 month of evolution, located in abdominal region and extremities, given few symptoms, associated with prolonged fever. He was hospitalized for proper study, in first instance infectious and immune causes were discarded and through lesions biopsy the diagnose of subcutaneous panniculitis-like-T cell lymphoma was reached. CONCLUSION: When FUO is diagnosed, most prevalent causes must be discarded. Then, differential diagnosis, such as immune and neoplasic etiologies, have to be considered. If FUO is associated to elemental nodular lesions, biopsy must be indicated early, in order to find potential malignant cases, avoiding therapeutic delay.",0,1392
1294,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic condition caused by antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex. This disorder is even more problematic in patients undergoing hemodialysis since they are repeatedly exposed to heparin.

Until now two cases of congenital presentation have been reported in the literature. This is the third case in a newborn; he has not followed the usual pattern associated with pulmonary hypertension as occurs in most patients with this pathology; the highest incidence is among 20-40 years old. We report a preterm newborn patient of 36 weeks of gestation with progressive respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation by constant desaturation during his clinical evolution without clinical, radiological or ultrasonographic signs of pulmonary hypertension.",0,841
1296,"Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphous fungus Histoplasma capsulatum (H. capsulatum). The fungus enters the body through the respiratory tract in the form of microconidia, which are transformed into intracellular yeast-like structures in the lungs before disseminating hematogenously. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic and self-resolving. Some patients develop severe disease with acute or chronic respiratory involvement. Immunosuppressed patients, mainly those with altered cellular immunity, may have disseminated disease with variable mucocutaneous involvement characterized by papules, nodules, gummas, or ulcers with a granulomatous base. We report the case of 3 HIV-negative patients infected by H capsulatum in whom diagnosis based on the skin lesions proved essential for early initiation of treatment.",0,842
1297,"According to scientific evidence, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is treated with anticoagulation therapy, involving different periods of time depending on the cause. Occasionally, recurrences appear in the same location, with May-Thurner syndrome or Cockett syndrome as one reason, due to compression of the ilio-cava venous system between the vertebral bodies and the arterial system. In these cases, anticoagulation therapy must be maintained during the same time as in the rest of DVT, but as opposed to them, thrombectomy is recommended, with or without the implant of a venous stent in order to avoid recurrence. There is no consensus in the literature regarding the indication of antiaggregation therapy after the anticoagulation therapy period. We present a case of May-Thurner syndrome treated with thrombectomy and the implant of a venous stent, which yielded an optimum management of the disease.",0,904
1298,"Nummular eczema or dermatitis is an uncommon paediatric pathology. It is presented as red-purplish small papules and vesicles that join to form exudative circular patches and then to eczematous or lichenified patches with discoid shape. The lesions appear predominantly on the extensor surface of extremities, although they can appear in trunk, hands or feet. This pathology has a clinical diagnosis; only few cases require complementary test. The topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of the treatment, and the causal treatment whether an infectious trigger is found. The patients have chronic or recurrent evolution. We report two cases in children with the aim of spreading knowledge among pediatricians.",0,710
1299,"Majocchi granuloma is an uncommon deep follicular inflammation caused by dermatophytes and affects immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The clinical findings overlap with other skin conditions such bacterial infections and inflammatory skin diseases, thereby delaying correct diagnosis. We describe 2 cases in immunocompetent patients.",0,346
1300,"Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of developing chronic respiratory infectious diseases. The Nocardia farcinica lung infection is rare in this group of patients, and there are limited publications about this topic. Its diagnosis is complex, due to the clinical and the radiology signs being non-specific. Identification of the agent responsible in the sputum culture is occasionally negative. It is a slow growing organism and for this reason treatment is delayed, which can lead to an increase in complications, hospitable stays, and mortality. A case is reported on a 26 year-old woman with cystic fibrosis and chronic lung colonization by Nocardia farcinica and Aspergillus fumigatus, on long-term treatment with ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and posaconazole, who was admitted to ICU after bilateral lung transplantation. The initial post-operative progress was satisfactory. After discharge, the patient showed a gradual respiratory insufficiency with new chest X-ray showing diffuse infiltrates. Initially, the agent was not seen in the sputum culture. Prompt and aggressive measures were taken, due to the high clinical suspicion of a Nocardia farcinica lung infection. Treatment with a combination of amikacin and meropenem, and later combined with linezolid, led to the disappearance of the lung infiltrates and a clinical improvement. In our case, we confirm the rapid introduction of Nocardia farcinica in the new lungs. The complex identification and the delay in treatment increased the morbimortality. There is a special need for its eradication in patients with lung transplant, due to the strong immunosuppressive treatment.",0,1671
1301,"INTRODUCTION: The Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disease of unknown origin characterized by recurrent and self-limited episodes of hypersomnia that are also accompanied by a cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Patients present normal sleeping and behavior patterns between episodes. CASE REPORTS: We present three patients who are 14 years old: two boys and one girl. They started having the episodes after a predisposing factor (vaccine, influenza B and menstruation). During the episode they presented hypersomnolence and while wakefulness they were bradipsychic, in motor restlessness and with emotional liability. They also presented a tendency towards crying and claimed the presence of relatives constantly. The episodes lasted between 10 and 15 days and they appeared monthly, being asymptomatic between episodes. All three patients were attended initially by pediatricians, diagnosed and treated as autoimmune encephalitis. Only one of our cases had the three typical symptoms of hypersomnia, hyperfagia and hypersexuality. However, none of the three had been asked initially and the family only referred to it after the directed anamnesis. CONCLUSIONS: The Kleine-Levin syndrome presents neurologic symptoms initially more frequently than psychiatric ones. Hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances during wakefulness, bradypsychia, apatheia and emotional liability make us suspect that it could be an encephalitis process. We should be aware of this entity if we face a patient with recurrent encephalitis of unknown origin.",0,1536
1302,"BACKGROUND: In our country, heart and kidney transplantation is a novel option for treatment of combined terminal heart and kidney failure. This program began in 2012 for selected patients with documented terminal heart failure and structural kidney damage with renal failure. Description of cases: Between January 1, 2012 and April 30, 2016, we made 92 orthotopic heart transplantations. In five of these cases the heart transplantation was combined with kidney transplantation. RESULTS: There were three male and two female patients with a mean age 25.6 +/- 5.2 years (range, 17-29). The patients improved their renal function and the heart transplantation was successful with an improved quality of life. One patient died from abdominal sepsis. The other patients are doing well. CONCLUSION: The combined heart-kidney transplantation is a safe and efficient procedure for patients with structural kidney and heart damage as a cause of terminal failure.",0,955
1303,"CLINICAL CASE: A patient with acute amaurosis due central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), who had mitral regurgitation and Streptococcus viridans positive blood cultures. Using transesophageal ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with native valve infective endocarditis without fever, and with loss of vision as the only symptom. DISCUSSION: CRAO due to infective endocarditis is rare and there are few cases reported in the literature. Semiology and a systematic and comprehensive study of patients with this ophthalmological pathology helps uncover serious underlying medical conditions. Infective endocarditis has many different forms of presentation and a high clinical suspicion is often required to reach a diagnosis.",0,726
1304,"INTRODUCTION: Alternating hemiplegic of childhood is a predominantly sporadic neurodevelopmental syndrome of uncertain etiology, characterized by alternating transient attacks of hemiplegia. Additional features include tonic fits, dystonic posturing, ocular motor abnormalities and deficits in cognitive functioning. CASE REPORT: A girl of 7 years-old with alternating hemiplegic of childhood. The first symptoms debut at 17 months of age in the form of lower limb weakness, migraine, nystagmus and hemiplegic crisis alternating both hemibodies. We administrate the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV (WISC-IV), the Conners Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II), the Conners scales for parents (CPRS-48) and teachers (CTRS-28) and the Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function (BRIEF). CONCLUSIONS: In our study we found deficits in sustained attention, reduced speed of information processing, and difficulties in understanding, speaking and working memory. In addition, parents and teachers reported behavioral disturbances, difficulties inhibition capability, in self-control and in regulating emotions.",0,1120
1305,"Even though amygdalar lesions are a known epilepsy model in laboratory animals, the role of the amygdala in mesial temporal sclerosis is not well-known. To date, most interest has been paid to the role of the hippocampal formation. The aim of this article is to emphasize the role of the amygdala in order to render a patient seizure free. Two patients are presented who were 50 and 42 years old at the time of surgery. They suffered from seizures since childhood and were diagnosed with mesial temporal sclerosis. A temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy and partial amygdalectomy was performed on both patients in the year 2000, with one patient operated on the right side and the other one on the left side. Both patients were seizure free after surgery for 6 years, but presented again with seizures after that time. They were evaluated again for surgery, and subdural grids were placed, together with a deep electrode in the remnants of the amygdala. The amygdalar electrode showed to be the seizure onset in the two cases, and its resection rendered both patients seizure free. These two patients show that a complete amygdalar resection is necessary to render some patients seizure free. It might be the amygdala has a greater role than previously thought.",0,1264
1306,"BACKGROUND: Evans syndrome is characterized by the reduction of at least two blood cell lineages in the absence of other diagnoses; it was previously described as the simultaneous or sequential development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia with unknown etiology. An incidence of 37% and mortality rate of 10% were reported for Evans syndrome. CLINICAL CASES: We report the clinical presentation and evolution of Evans syndrome in two infants who were initially diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia. The clinical diagnosis was supported on complementary studies, where hematological disorders were corroborated. Both cases received treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. CONCLUSIONS: For the management of children with thrombocytopenia, the pediatrician must analyze for other cell lineage disorders. In the cases that we report here, we found the presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and monocytosis. Therefore, infectious and immunological studies must be included. The first-line treatment of choice are steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin can be considered if severe immune thrombocytopenia is associated, as observed in these cases.",0,1189
1307,"Tumors of the carotid body are uncommon neoplasms that originate in the neuroectoderm. These tumors are slow growing but well vascularized and very destructive. Between 5% and 13% of carotid body tumors are malignant, behaving aggressively at the local level, invading the adjacent lymph nodes, and resulting in remote metastases. We present the case of a 60-year-old man who was examined for pain and paresthesias in his arm. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large tumor in the left carotid space. Histologic study of a biopsy specimen from the tumor revealed that it was a paraganglioma. Further studies to determine the extent of disease detected metastases in bone and lung, confirming the tumor's malignancy.",0,716
1308,"Bloody diarrhea is a common problem in early childhood, typically caused by anal fissures, infectious enteritis, allergic proctocolitis, swallowed maternal blood and intussusception. More rarely, it can also be caused by volvulus, coagulopathies, necrotizing enterocolitis, polyps, Meckel diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of IBD is on the rise in children, even affecting infants. The most common subtypes are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While IBD occurrence peaks in the second to third decades of life, paediatric IBD accounts for 7-20% of all cases. Within this age group, the highest rates are seen in the teenage years; however, very early onset IBD can be seen before six years of age. The classic symptoms of CD include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss, while UC is typically associated with bloody diarrhea. The report describes the case of a 20-month-old boy with bloody diarrhea who was ultimately diagnosed with UC.",0,990
1309,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has an incomparable efficacy to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, with near 90% of success. We report a 57 years old woman who developed an antibiotic associated diarrhea with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for Clostridium Difficile toxin. She was successfully treated with Vancomycin trice but diarrhea recurred. Therefore a fecal microbiota transplant was performed using solid stools from a relative, diluted in saline and instilled in the distal ileon, with a good clinical response, without recurrence of diarrhea, during a 6-month follow-up.",0,612
1310,"BACKGROUND: Fungal infections should be suspected in severe wounds that have been contaminated with organic material or soil, even when the patient is immunocompetent. The aim of this article is to contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of the antifungal sensitivity and epidemiology of some rare pathogens that may trigger severe infections. CASE REPORT: Four different moulds were isolated from the wounds of an immunocompetent woman who was involved in a road accident: Lichtheimia corymbifera, Scedosporium boydii, Fusarium solani and Purpureocillium lilacinum. Some of them were isolated from different sites. A profile of in vitro resistance was performed with an Epsilometer (Etest) using five antifungal agents: voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, anidulafungin an amphotericin B. The results obtained were consistent with those from other cases reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Early aggressive surgery, antifungal therapy and, above all, frequent debridement of necrotic tissue, are the tools against filamentous fungi infections. Antifungal sensitivity of any mould involved in an infection has to be determined, in order to a better understanding of these rare pathogens whose incidence is increasing.",0,1239
1311,CLINICAL CASE: We report a case of a 31 year-old woman with a sudden visual loss due to a cilioretinal artery occlusion. The physical examinination showed hepatomegaly. Serum iron and ferritin and transferrin saturation were unusually high. The doppler scan of carotid arteries showed no relevant signs of atheromatous disease. Dilated cardiomiopaty was revealed in the B-scan with subendocardial calcium deposits. Genetic tests were positive for hemochromatosis. DISCUSSION: Subendocardial calcification due to hemochromatosis could be the embolic source in our patient. This embolic ocular disease is the first presentation of hemochromatosis in this patient.,0,661
1312,"Stiff-person syndrome is characterized by persistent muscle spasms, involving agonist and antagonist muscles simultaneously, starting in the lower limbs and trunk. It tends to occur in the fourth to sixth decade of life, presenting with intermittent spasms that later become continuous and usually painful. Minor sensory stimuli, such as noise or light touch, precipitate severe spasms. Spasms do not occur during sleep and only rarely involve cranial muscles. We present a case that for two years was diagnosed and treated as a conversion disorder associated with depression. After two years she was admitted to another hospital with an unmistakable picture of stiff-person syndrome with hypertrophy and rigidity of lower limb muscles, compatible electrophysiology and positive anti-GAD antibodies. She had autoimmune hypothyroidism, that should have raised the suspicion of stiff-person syndrome earlier. She responded to intravenous immunoglobulin and mycophenolate mofetil and and to tranquilizers that have muscle relaxant properties.",0,1039
1313,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) are acute, rare, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathies that require swift management. We report a case of acute microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) presenting in perioperative setting. CLINICAL CASE: After hepatic pericystectomy for hydatid cyst, a 46-year-old female developed MAHA, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure in the immediate postoperative period. ""aHUS"" was considered and immediate plasma exchange was initiated. Plasma exchange was performed for 2 weeks with remission of renal dysfunction. Further evaluation of genetic mutations and immunological causes for MAHA were sought. Mutations in complement factor H associated with factor H deficiency were identified, which are associated with increased risk of aHUS. CONCLUSION: MAHA is a rare postoperative condition, requiring rapid differential diagnosis and treatment. Anaesthetists should bear in mind aHUS as a possible cause of MAHA, especially concerning immediate care for these patients.",0,1090
1314,"INTRODUCTION: Pityriasis lichenoides is a benign inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. There are two types of this condition: an acute form (PLEVA = pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta) and a chronic one (PLC = pityriasis lichenoid chronica). Both are more common in children and young adults. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of PLC, discuss its clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and present a review of the literature. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old child who presented with recurrent oligosymptomatic episodes of bright erythematous papular lesions in centripetal distribution, which subsided and left behind hypopigmented macules. The biopsy of the lesions confirmed chronic pityriasis lichenoid. During the 3 years of follow-up, multiple treatment regimens were used to reduce exacerbations, resulting in a partial response. CONCLUSION: PLC is a rare disease that represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the physician. The diagnosis of this condition is suspected clinically and confirmed by histology. It does not have specific treatment, but it responds well to corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunosuppressants and phototherapy with UVB narrowband (UVBnb). The latter has given the best results. It is important to monitor patients for risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders.",0,1325
1315,"BACKGROUND: Small bowel volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adult patients. This disease is more common in children and its aetiology and management is different to that in adults. CLINICAL CASE: A 30 year-old male with sarcoidosis presents with acute abdomen and clinical data of intestinal obstruction. Small bowel volvulus is diagnosed by a contrast abdominal tomography and an exploratory laparotomy is performed with devolvulation and no intestinal resection. In the days following surgery, he developed a recurrent small bowel volvulus, which was again managed with surgery, but without intestinal resection. Medical treatment for sarcoidosis was started, and with his clinical progress being satisfactory,he was discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS: Making an early and correct diagnosis of small bowel volvulus prevents large intestinal resections. Many surgical procedures have been described with a high rate of complications. Therefore, conservative surgical management (no intestinal resection) is recommended as the best treatment with the lowest morbidity and mortality rate.",0,1102
1316,"Intestinal vascular malformations, especially those in the right colon, are a frequent cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults, but they are a very rare condition in children. Symptoms include acute hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, or chronic anemia of uncertain etiology, which is the most frequent form of presentation but the most difficult to diagnose and thus properly treat. We report the case of an 11 year old boy admitted to the Emergency Room with abdominal pain, vomits, hemodynamic decompensation, who required expansion and blood transfusion. With history ofrecurrent bloody stools since infancy with repeated normal endoscopies and Tc99 scintigraphy with chronic anemia and no improvement despite adequate treatment. In the last admission, the videocolonoscopy detected a venous vascular malformation in the ileocecal region. The angiography and the entero multislice computer tomography scanner were valuable tools to confirm the diagnosis and to select the appropriate surgical procedure for this rare condition.",0,1042
1317,"CLINICAL CASE: Patient with AIDS and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) uveitis. The PCR of the aqueous and vitreous humor was positive for EBV, and DNA quantification was 56.602x10(6) copies/ml in the vitreous humor, 173,400 copies/ml in the peripheral blood, and negative in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient developed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), diagnosed in the autopsy. CONCLUSION: The EBV is a rare cause of uveitis and it may be necessary to perform a quantitative PCR to reach the diagnosis. High amounts of EBV DNA are associated with a greater incidence of NHL.",0,574
1318,"Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for approximately 5-10% of patients presenting with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The majority of lesions responsible were found to be located in the small bowel. Currently, capsule en-doscopy is the first-line tool to investigate the small bowel as it is a non-invasive, feasible and simple procedure. Howe-ver, capsule endoscopy sometimes identifies the source of bleeding outside the small bowel and within the reach of conventional endoscopy. We present the case of a 46 year-old man with few prior negative endoscopic procedures and iron-deficiency anaemia due to gastric GIST.",0,625
1319,"Pseudotumor cerebri is a syndrome characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure greater than 20 cmH2O with ventricles and cerebrospinal fluid of normal characteristics. Consumption of minocycline have been described among the causes associated with this syndrome. We present a 13-year old female patient with a history of acne treated with minocycline who began with severe headache, diplopia and blurred vision. The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made, indicating the immediate antibiotic suspension and the beginning of the treatment with acetazolamide. Although the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri is not fully known, an association with minocycline has been observed. This antibiotic is often used by health professionals for the management of acne, so it is important to consider its complications before being prescribed.",0,842
1320,"Backgronund: Bronchogenic cysts result from abnormal budding of the primitive tracheobronchial tube and are rare congenital cystic lesions. The location of the cyst depends on the embryological stage of abnormal budding. Although periesophageal bronchogenic cysts have been frequently reported, a completely intramural cyst is very rare. Clinical case: A 42-year-old female patient, a three-month course with retrosternal pain associated with food intake, accompanied by intermittent dysphagia to solids. Esophagogram, high resolution thoracic tomography and endoscopic ultrasound are performed, concluding a probable esophageal bronchogenic cyst. Resection is performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery, without complications. Patient presents with adequate evolution and complete remission of the symptomatology. Conclusion: Bronchogenic cysts of the esophageal wall are extremely uncommon lesions. Its surgical treatment is indicated to be symptomatic; video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery resection is of choice, with excellent long-term results and minimal morbidity.",0,1074
1321,"INTRODUCTION: Pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome (PNE) is characterised by the presence of neuropathic pain in the pudendal nerve (PN) territory, associated or not with urinary, defecatory and sexual disorders. Surgical PN decompression is an effective and safe alternative for cases when conservative treatment fails. The aim of this study is to describe the first robot-assisted pudendal neurolysis procedure performed in our country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe step by step the technique of robot-assisted laparoscopic neurolysis of the left PN performed with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring on a 60-year-old patient diagnosed with left PNE. RESULTS: The procedure was performed satisfactorily without complications. After 24h, the patient was discharged from the hospital. We observed a 50% reduction in pain measured using the visual analogue scale 2 weeks after the procedure, which remained after 10 weeks of the neurolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted neurolysis of the PN constitutes a feasible and safe approach, enabling better visualisation and accuracy in the dissection of the PN. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is useful for locating the PN and for detecting intraoperative changes after the release of the nerve.",0,1262
1322,"The treatment of a chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon remains difficult. Different techniques such as augmentation or plasties are used for restoring the gap in these ruptures. The combination of Achilles tendon rupture with other tendon ruptures may increase the difficulty in their treatment. We present a rare combination of a delayed Achilles tendon rupture and a peroneus brevis tendon rupture and its management. The importance of the presented case is the combination of both ruptures that adds difficulty to the surgical technique. A thorough analysis should be made of the magnetic resonance findings when planning a tendon transposition. To our knowledge, there are no reports of a simultaneous combination of an Achilles tendon rupture and a peroneus brevis tendon rupture.",0,788
1324,"INTRODUCTION: Vertebral hypoplasia is an anomaly of the vertebral bodies, in which they present a wedge shape, usually at the level of the thoracolumbar junction. Although it is associated with cer tain storage diseases and bone dysplasias, it is also possible to find isolated vertebral hypoplasia it in healthy infants or associated with thoracolumbar kyphosis. The objective of this report is to show the evolution of vertebral hypoplasia associated to kyphosis in two apparently health children. CASE REPORT: Two cases of infants diagnosed with clinically visible lumbar kyphosis when they were sitting. Spine X-rays of both showed lumbar vertebral hypoplasia at L2 level as the only finding. After ruling out other conditions associated with vertebral hypoplasia, conservative management was indicated; in the first case a clinical-radiological follow-up and in the second one, a corset given the magnitude of kyphosis. The evolution was favorable, with complete radiological clinical resolution at the age of 15 months in the first case and clinical regression in the second, in which, at 3 years and 4 months of age, an image of mild vertebral hypoplasia persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated vertebral hypoplasia or associated to kyphosis may be considered a minor anomaly or anatomic variant of infant spine development, however, it requires follow-up until its normalization.",0,1380
1325,"Acute lead poisoning is not a common pathology seen in the pediatrician's office. Lead poisoning symptoms can be digestive or neurological, and they can be confused with other pathologies. That is the reason why it should be considered and, in case of doubt, complementary studies to confirm lead poisoning should be requested. This is the case of a nine-year-old child that comes to the office with a strong abdominal pain and vomiting, and after a close physical examination and a detailed anamnesis, a suspicious diagnosis of ""acute"" lead poisoning is obtained. Therefore, the infant is hospitalized, and after taking a venous sampling to confirm the lead level, a chelation therapy is performed under the toxicology expert's supervision.",0,741
1326,"A case is presented of a retained Descemet's membrane after penetrating keratoplasty, highlighting the importance of the anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the diagnosis and treatment planning of keratoplasty complications. A review of literature is also presented. An 88 year-old man underwent penetrating keratoplasty for bullous keratopathy. A retained host Descemet's membrane was detected. The retained membrane went unnoticed until the visual acuity decreased. The ophthalmological examination showed the presence of an opalescent membrane located below the endothelium, and was identified as the Descemet membrane of the receptor. Nd:YAG laser membranotomy was performed after the diagnosis. To conclude, it is noted that the inadvertent retention of the host Descemet membrane is a rare complication in penetrating keratoplasty. The anterior segment OCT was used to determine the diagnosis, and Nd:YAG laser membranotomy is an indicated treatment in these cases.",0,990
1327,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal obstruction in children may be congenital, acquired, intrinsic or extrinsic. Most intestinal obstructions in children are the result of postoperative adhesions. Those caused by anomalous congenital band are extremely rare. CLINICAL CASE: Patient of a 1-year-old male, with no previous history of abdominal surgery or trauma. He suffered with vomiting of bile content and loss of appetite at home three days before admission. On physical examination, he was irritable, with abdominal distention, absence of peristalsis and abdominal tenderness, with no signs of peritoneal irritation being found. The blood count reported leucocytosis and the x-rays show dilated small bowel loops, fluid levels and absence of air in rectal ampulla. An open laparotomy was subsequently performed, and the intraoperative findings were consistent with a congenital band extending from the anti-mesenteric wall of the jejunum to the root of mesentery, compressing the ileum at 50cm from the ileocecal valve, causing ischaemia. The band was ligated and divided, with an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged 4 days later without complications. CONCLUSIONS: The anomalous congenital band is not associated with abdominal problems, such as remnants of previous laparotomies or embryological structures, such as vitelline vessels or omphalomesenteric yolk duct. These bands seem to have a congenital origin and cause bowel obstruction by trapping between the band and the mesentery. The diagnosis of anomalous congenital band is extremely difficult and no imaging study is useful for the diagnosis, and only exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy is useful for diagnosis and treatment of this problem.",0,1711
1328,"INTRODUCTION: Among the causes of peripheral precocious puberty in men are the beta-human cho rionic gonadotropin (Beta-HCG)-secreting tumors, such as hepatoblastomas, dysgerminomas, chorio carcinomas, and immature teratomas. In pediatrics, the mediastinal teratomas are rare, representing the 7-10% of extragonadal teratomas. OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a patient with peripheral precocious puberty due to a Beta-HCG -secreting thymic teratoma. CLINICAL CASE: A seven-years-old schoolboy presents a three-months history of voice changes, gynecomastia, pubic hair appearance, and increased genital volume. In the exams, bone age of nine years, total testosterone 9.33ng/ml (< 0.4ng/ml), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), and normal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test stand out; luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) with low basal levels, Beta-HCG 39.5mU/ml (< 2.5 mUI/ml), alpha feto protein (alpha-FP) 11,2ng/ml (0.6-2.0 ng/ml). Imaging study to determine the origin of Beta-HCG secretion shows normal testicular ultrasound and thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic computerized axial tomo graphy (CAT); brain and sellar resonance without significant findings. The positron emission tomography/computed scan (PET SCAN) shows a tumor image in the anterosuperior mediastinum. The tumor is resected, and the biopsy shows an immature cystic teratoma in the thymus. Post-operatory evolution was satisfactory, with normalization of hormonal levels. CONCLUSION: The appearance of a teratoma in a pediatric patient is rare, even more if it is immature, with thymic location and P-HCG- secretor. It is important to consider it within the differential diagnosis facing precocious puberty, as a better way to handle appropriately.",0,1792
1329,"Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly recognized cause of diarrhea in inpatients, frequently associated to high mortality. Vancomycin is the treatment of choice for all Clostridium difficile- associated diarrheas, with different degrees of severity. However, some patients develop refractory forms to that treatment and there are no alternative antibiotic schemes recommended for these cases. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be successful in a series of cases of severe diarrhea associated with this organism.

1332,"Numerous publications have emerged on the application of erector spinae plane block in adult population. There are few reports of the use of this block in pediatric patients. The objective is to report 2 cases of adolescents, one diagnosed with pectus excavatum and the other one with pectus carinatum undergoing reconstructive surgery in which a bilateral single-shot erector spinae plane block was performed as an analgesic technique. The block was performed before surgery under general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position, guided by ultrasound using 20ml of 0.25% bupivacaine per side. After the surgery they were extubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. During their postoperative period they had visual analogic scale values less than 4 and no long term narcotics were used during the intraoperative and postoperative period. Bilateral single shot erector spinae plane block was effective as an analgesic technique for the intraoperative and postoperative period in pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum surgery in adolescents.",0,1051
1333,"INTRODUCTION: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterised by the presence of pain accompanied by sensory, autonomic and motor symptoms, usually preceded by a lesion or immobilisation. The clinical course is disproportionate to the initial injury in intensity and in duration. Its distribution is regional, predominantly in limbs. It is classified as type I and type II according to the absence or presence of nerve injury. CASES: We present the cases of seven children, 6 girls and 1 boy, aged 7 to 15 years. Three had a history of previous trauma. In 5 cases, the symptoms were located in the lower limbs. Time to diagnosis was between 4 and 90 days. Three patients had clinical features of anxiety and depression. Imaging and immunological studies were performed to rule out differential diagnoses in all the children. Interdisciplinary treatment was performed with physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and gabapentin or pregabalin. All patients had a good clinical outcome, with no relapses in the follow-up period (between 4 and 30 months). CONCLUSIONS: CRPS is frequently unrecognised in children, leading to family anxiety and unnecessary para-clinical costs. Paediatricians and paediatric neurologists should be aware of this syndrome in order to avoid delay in diagnosis, unnecessary studies, and multiple visits to specialists, with a view to providing effective treatment.",0,1386
1334,"We present a case of cleidocranial dysplasia diagnosed by low-dose fetal computed tomography (CT) in the 25th week of gestation. Severe bone dysplasia was suspected because of the fetus' low percentile in long bones length and the appearance of craniosynostosis on sonography. CT found no abnormalities incompatible with life. The effective dose was 5 mSv, within the recommended range for this type of examination. Low-dose fetal CT is a new technique that makes precision study of the bony structures possible from the second trimester of pregnancy. In Spain, abortion is legal even after the 22nd week of gestation in cases of severe fetal malformations. Therefore, in cases in which severe bone dysplasia is suspected, radiologists must know the strategies for reducing the dose of radiation while maintaining sufficient diagnostic quality, and they must also know which bony structures to evaluate.",0,903
1335,"Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease of global distribution with a higher incidence in developing countries, where it represents one of the main causes of meningitis, associated with high morbidity and mortality. It mainly occurs in patients with immunosuppression (due to HIV infection, glucocorticoid treatment, transplants, cancer, etc.). However, in recent years there has been an increase in cases in immunocompetent, which is as serious or more severe than in immunocompromised. We report two cases of cryptococcal meningitis. A 48-year-old male with no pathological history, in whom HIV infection or another cause of immunosuppression was ruled out, and a 67-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The above mentioned highlights the importance of always considering Cryptococcus spp. as possible causative agent of meningitis, in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.",0,909
1336,"Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare disease characterized by deficiency in development of structure derived from the ectoderm and is caused by mutations in the genes EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD. Phenotypes caused by mutations in these three may exhibit similar clinical features, explained by a common signaling pathway. Mutations in EDA gene cause X linked HED, which is the most common form. Mutations in EDAR and EDARADD genes cause autosomal dominant and recessive form of HED. The most striking clinical findings in HED are hypodontia, hypotrichosis and hypohidrosis that can lead to episodes of hyperthermia. We report on clinical findings in a child with HED with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a heterozygous mutation c.1072C>T (p.Arg358X) in the EDAR gene. A review of the literature with regard to other cases presenting the same mutation has been carried out and discussed.",0,905
1337,"Malignant hyperthermia syndrome is a family myopathy of pharmacogenetic nature, which appears as a skeletal muscle hypercatabolic syndrome linked to anesthesia. The incidence in pediatrics is 1 event per 10 000 surgeries. The clinical picture may have a rapid onset associated with succinylcholine, or a late onset related to inhalation agents. The clinical picture includes tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypercapnia, acidosis, muscle rigidity, hyperkalemia, renal failure and arrhythmia. Mortality without specific treatment is of 80% and drops to 7% with the use of dantrolene sodium. We report an 8-year-old patient admitted for phimosis surgery; having tachycardia, hypercapnia and muscle rigidity, he started treatment with dantrolene sodium in the operating room, which was maintained for 72 hours. He evolved the first 12 hours with low cardiac output and creatine phosphokinase maximum of 155,147 U/L. He remained with mechanical ventilation for 48 hours. Discharge was given on the sixth day without sequelae.",0,1015
1338,"A 58 year-old woman presented with severe chemosis and ophthalmoparesis on her left eye 8hours after uncomplicated cataract surgery under sub-tenon anaesthesia. Recovery of extrinsic motility was observed after corticosteroid and antihistamine treatment, but a non-haemorrhagic papillary oedema and a concentric defect of visual field were found. It progressed to papillary atrophy with preserved central vision, but with a significant visual field constriction. The aetiological study revealed an allergy to hyaluronidase that was used as adjuvant to the anaesthesia. This complication needs to be promptly diagnosed and treated, as the swelling of the orbital tissues can cause damage to the optic nerve.",0,706
1339,"BACKGROUND: Obturator hernia is a rare variety of abdominal hernia, it accounts for 0.07%-1.0% of all hernias, and occurs most often in women of advanced age and multiparous. CLINICAL CASE: A 78-year-old female was admitted to the Emergency Department due to nausea, vomiting, complaints of abdominal discomfort and obstipation for the last 7 days. Abdominal CT scan showed dilated small bowel loops and multiple air-fluid levels near to a small bowel loop obturator hernia, between external obturator and pectineus muscle. Emergency laparotomy was performed and during the surgery, loop of small intestine was revealed herniated into the obturator foramen, 130cm from the angle of Treitz. Necrosis of small intestine was found, without perforation. Resection of the 10cm affected jejunal segment was performed and a side-to-side bowel anastomosis was fashioned. Also simple suture closure of obturator foramen was performed. CONCLUSION: Obturator hernia is relatively rare. However physicians should keep it in mind and have clinical suspicion for obturator hernia as a cause of intestinal obstruction in female, elderly and multiparous patients in order to make an appropriate diagnosis and avoid bowel ischaemia.",0,1215
1340,"INTRODUCTION: Hypokalaemia is a common clinical problem. A potential but commonly overlooked cause of hypokalaemia is Gitelman syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 26-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to syncope with general and muscular weakness and muscle cramps. The patient's history revealed previous recurrent syncope events associated to hypokalaemia with the lowest serum potassium value being 2.6mmol/l. At admission, blood pressure was normal and no changes were found at physical examination. Laboratory tests showed mild hypokalaemia (3.0mmol/l), hypomagnesaemia (1.36mg/dl), hypocalciuria (< 40mg/24h), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3(-) 29.7mmol/l, BE 5.3mmol/l). RESULTS: Further laboratory tests (FeK, TTKG) confirmed inappropriate kaliuresis. Conn's disease was excluded by hormonal and imaging assessments. Genetic testing was performed and two novel heterozygous mutations: c.35_36insA and c.1095+5G>A were found in transcript NM_000339.2 in SLC12A3 gene. CONCLUSION: The patient was diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome and was treated with supplements of potassium and magnesium.",0,1103
1341,"Rapidly growing non-tuberculosis mycobacteria are a rare cause of bacterial endocarditis. During the last decades, there has been an increase in infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria, mainly after trauma and post-surgical procedures, both localized and disseminated, as well as nosocomial outbreaks due to contamination of medical equipment. Routine acid-fast staining for blood culture bottles is not always performed; however, the microbiologist should be aware of potential RGM infections especially when gram positive bacilli are observed. We describe a case of endocarditis caused by Mycobacterium mageritense in a patient with an autologous pericardial patch and a pressure catheter in the left auricle. The bacterial species was identified as Mycobacterium mageritense by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), score 2.3, and confirmed by 16S rRNA analysis with 99.8 and 100% agreement, respectively.",0,911
1342,"Because of its own unfavourable evolution, HIV infection was until recently considered a contraindication for organ transplantation. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy prolonged the life expectancy of these patients and allowed the manifestation of disorders directly or indirectly related to HIV infection, mainly liver, kidney and cardiovascular diseases. We present a case of cardiac transplantation due to dilated cardiomyopathy that was performed in a patient with a recently detected HIV infection. At 24 month follow-up, the patient is in very good health status, his CD4 are increasing and the viral load is undetectable. He did not present transplant rejection or any other complication. To our knowledge, there is no previous publication on heart transplantation in patients with HIV in South America. In view of the successful outcome of our case and of the few cases reported in the international literature, we consider that heart transplantation is a therapeutic option in correctly selected HIV patients.",0,1041
1343,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea. We summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the first Korean case of MERS-CoV and analyzed whole-genome sequences of MERS-CoV derived from the patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man developed fever and myalgia 7 days after returning to Korea, following a 10-day trip to the Middle East. Before diagnosis, he visited 4 hospitals, potentially resulting in secondary transmission to 28 patients. On admission to the National Medical Center (day 9, post-onset of clinical illness), he presented with drowsiness, hypoxia, and multiple patchy infiltrations on the chest radiograph. He was intubated (day 12) because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and INF-alpha2a and ribavirin treatment was commenced. The treatment course was prolonged by superimposed ventilator associated pneumonia. MERS-CoV PCR results converted to negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged (day 137), following rehabilitation therapy. The complete genome sequence obtained from a sputum sample (taken on day 11) showed the highest sequence similarity (99.59%) with the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and was associated with a severe clinical course. The patient made a successful recovery after early treatment with antiviral agents and adequate supportive care. This first case in South Korea became a super-spreader because of improper infection control measures, rather than variations of the virus.",1,1711
1344,"INTRODUCTION: Pineal cysts are a relatively frequent incidental finding in imaging tests; yet, pineal apoplexy is considered to be rare and is associated to severe symptoms. CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of a 25-year-old male and a female aged 15 years who visited the emergency department with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The existence of a pineal haemorrhage was confirmed by imaging tests. They were successfully treated by means of microsurgery. CONCLUSION: In our experience, and backed by the literature, we believe that the best treatment for this infrequent pathology is the microsurgical approach. Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that, sometime in the future, endoscopic techniques may play an important role in the treatment of pineal apoplexy.",0,796
1345,"BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma has a natural tendency to extend through the renal vein. When the thrombus reaches the vena cava, thrombectomy and the necessary reconstruction of the vena cava are typically performed by open pathway. Robot-assisted technology provides advantages for performing this complex technique, using a minimally invasive access. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the technique we employed in the first case performed in our department. After performing renal artery embolisation, we conducted the surgery with the Vinci S robotic system. The main steps of the surgery are as follows: detachment and Kocher manoeuvre; release of the lower renal pole; clamping and sectioning of the renal artery; endocavitary ultrasound to locate the thrombus; placement of tourniquets in the vena cava below and above the renal veins and in the left renal vein; closure of the 3 tourniquets; opening of the vena cava; resection and extraction of the thrombus; suture of the vena cava; opening of the tourniquets; complete release of the kidney; bagging and extraction of the specimen. RESULTS: The surgery was performed without complications. The patient required a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and was discharged with modest renal failure (creatinine level of 1.60mg/dl). CONCLUSIONS: Radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy in the vena cava is a technique susceptible to severe complications and has, to date, been performed in few centres. We believe that the technique is reproducible and has clear advantages for our patients.",0,1557
1346,"An imaging case is presented on a patient referred to our department for an (18)F-FDG-PET/CT, as a paraneoplastic syndrome was suspected due to his clinical situation. He had a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated two years earlier, with sustained complete remission to date. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT findings revealed hypermetabolism in almost all nerve roots, suggesting meningeal spread, consistent with the subsequent MRI findings. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings confirmed a leptomeningeal reactivation of AML. Although not many studies have evaluated the role of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT in leukemia, it is a noninvasive tool for detecting extramedullary sites of disease and a good imaging alternative for those patients on whom an MRI cannot be performed.",0,761
1347,"Non-intubated thoracic surgery entails procedures performed through regional anesthesia method in awake or mildly sedated, spontaneously ventilating patients. This method represents advantages for the cardiovascular system, and reduces the orotracheal trauma, postoperative atelectasis, and pneumonia. It also possibly reduces costs. Other theoretical advantages are: easier acceptance of surgery, attenuated stress hormone and immune response, and possibly a better survival in oncological surgery. We show a 34-year-old woman with sever palmar-axillary hyperhidrosis. We performed the procedure with local anesthesia (ropivacaine 2 mg/ml) 5 ml in each wound trocar; 20 ml inside the thoracic cavity. The patient was mildly sedated with fentanyl and dexmedetomidine. The procedure was very simple, the patient was included in an outpatient program 90 minutes after the surgery. We conclude that sympathectomy with a non-intubated patient is safe and could be the beginning of other kinds of more complex procedures.",0,1016
1348,"CASE REPORT: An 18-year-old man, presented a lower vitreous hemorrhage of unknown cause. Multiple tests are performed, including Ophthalmic Ultrasound and Fluorescein Angioghaphy (FA), they did not find justification of bleeding. Finally, we decide to do a Biomocroscopia Ultrasonic (UBM) showing an iridociliary cyst. DISCUSSION: The iridociliary cysts are single or multiple, primary or secondary. The primaries are usually benign so, they do not require treatment. When the cyst has a considerable size, it may produce a focal plateau iris with or without angle-closure. Our case reveals an unusual complication that should take notice of when you have an unknown vitreous hemorrhage.",0,687
1349,"Infection with Strongyloides stercoralis is a common parasitic infection in tropical and subtropical regions, including the Peruvian Amazon. The clinical manifestations are varied in patients with immunocompromised disease, and the systemic spread of the disease is frequent, compromising different organs and systems. Cutaneous manifestations are infrequent, being described in patients with some degree of immunosuppression. We present the case of an immunocompetent patient who developed a reactive purpura due to chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection. Thus, skin involvement is possible in immunocompetent patients with systemic exacerbation due to this parasite.",0,673
1350,"INTRODUCTION: Situs inversus of the optic nerve is a congenital anomaly characterised by the emergence of the vessels in the retina towards the nose rather than in a temporal direction. It is caused by an anomalous insertion of the optic stalks into the optic vesicle that gives rise to dysversion of the head of the optic nerve. It is not an isolated condition and usually appears jointly with tilted disc syndrome and in patients with myopia. It is characterised by the presence of inferior conus atrophy, deficiencies in the temporal visual field, refraction defects and ambliopy. CASE REPORT: A 22 years-old female who attended an ophthalmological examination due to severe frontal headaches accompanied by halos and loss of sharpness in her sight. From the results of the ophthalmetric and ophthalmological examination she was diagnosed as suffering from a condition consistent with this congenital anatomical anomaly. CONCLUSIONS: Situs inversus of the optic nerve is a rare condition that may appear in isolation or accompanied by other pathologies. Application of the visual field test and new diagnostic techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, facilitates the differential diagnosis of this situation. Its prevalence remains unknown, as it is not included in the register of rare diseases. Moreover, the scant number of patients studied and the scarce literature on this anomaly do not allow us to know whether the defects it causes develop over time. It would therefore be important to perform an ophthalmological follow-up of patients with situs inversus of the optic nerve.",0,1595
1351,"Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas, characterized by abdominal pain and high level of pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatitis is the most common disease of pancreas in children and adults. For the diagnosis we need 2 of 3 characteristics: abdominal pain characteristic of acute pancreatitis, amylase and/or lipase 3 times higher than the normal upper limit and characteristic findings in images. The etiologies are multiple: trauma, metabolic disease and infections: mixovirus, HIV, measles, coxsackie, hepatitis B, C, cytomegalovirus, varicella, herpes simplex.

1352,"OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer is a commonly diagnosed malignancy in Europe, being 30% muscle-invasive at diagnosis. In these patients, metastases can develop both at diagnosis and after progression. Metastatic disease can manifest in a number of different ways, even as hydroelectrolytic alterations. In this work, we go through the causes of hyponatremia in patients suffering from bladder cancer and its relationship with disseminated disease. METHOD: We present two cases of patients with muscleinvasive bladder cancer with a common electrolytic misbalance, hyponatremia. RESULTS: As a result of the study, bone and cerebral metastases were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The electrolytic alterations in the oncologic patient can have several causes: chemotherapy, urinary diversion, pain, or even to the tumor itself or its metastases. It is necessary to conduct an exhaustive study in order to discard the most important causes of hyponatremia and be able to decide an appropriate treatment.",0,984
1353,"PURPOSE: To assess if combined fluorescence- and radio-guided occult lesion localization (hybrid ROLL) is feasible in patients scheduled for surgical resection of non-palpable (18)F-FDG-avid lesions on PET/CT. METHODS: Four patients with (18)F-FDG-avid lesions on follow-up PET/CT that were not palpable during physical examination but were suspected to harbor metastasis were enrolled. Guided by ultrasound, the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid was injected centrally in the target lesion. SPECT/CT imaging was used to confirm tracer deposition. Intraoperatively, lesions were localized using a hand-held gamma ray detection probe, a portable gamma camera, and a fluorescence camera. After excision, the gamma camera was used to check the wound bed for residual activity. RESULTS: A total of six (18)F-FDG-avid lymph nodes were identified and scheduled for hybrid ROLL. Comparison of the PET/CT images with the acquired SPECT/CT after hybrid tracer injection confirmed accurate tracer deposition. No side effects were observed. Combined radio- and fluorescence-guidance enabled localization and excision of the target lesion in all patients. Five of the six excised lesions proved tumor-positive at histopathology. CONCLUSION: The hybrid ROLL approach appears to be feasible and can facilitate the intraoperative localization and excision of non-palpable lesions suspected to harbor tumor metastases. In addition to the initial radioguided detection, the fluorescence component of the hybrid tracer enables high-resolution intraoperative visualization of the target lesion. The procedure needs further evaluation in a larger cohort and wider range of malignancies to substantiate these preliminary findings.",0,1733
1354,"Uterine rupture is a rare but severe complication in obstetrics. A previous C-section is the most important risk factor. Its incidence during labor in women with a previous C-section is of approximately 0.3-0.47%, being potentially severe. We present the case of a pregnant women with a previous C-section who suffered uterine rupture during labor. The rapid assessment and action of the midwife and obstetric team was essential to obtain a successful obstetric outcome, avoiding maternal and fetal mortality; and nursing care given to the mother and the newborn after birth contributed to achieving a normal postpartum.

1357,"Medial meatal fibrosis is a rare condition in which the medial portion of the external auditory canal is obliterated with fibrous tissue. We selected 4 cases of patients with medial meatal fibrosis with a history of recurrent otorrhea who underwent surgery during the years of 2012 and 2013, presenting the surgical results here. Physical examination showed an obliterated external auditory canal and conductive hypoacusis. All cases were solved using a split thickness skin graft from the thigh. The surgical principles that appear to correlate with a favorable outcome are the removal of all fibrous tissue and unhealthy skin, a wide canaloplasty and the use of a split thickness skin graft.",0,693
1358,"A 30-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of erosive stomatitis and bullous lesions, along with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain. She was found to have a retroperitoneal lump in left lumbar region. Skin biopsy revealed bullous disorder. CT guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was suggestive of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). She was started on oral steroids and supportive care, and surgery was being planned when she developed respiratory failure. CT chest revealed vertebral metastases. PET/CT for whole body work up revealed a left para-aortic mass along with multiple skeletal metastases. The patient was kept on conservative management. After 3 months, the patient has shown clinical improvement, and an exploratory laparotomy is now being planned for the excision of the tumor, followed by chemotherapy. This case of retroperitoneal IMT is rare in terms of skeletal metastases with paraneoplastic pemphigus.",0,946
1359,"INTRODUCTION: Tinea nigra is a superficial mycosis caused by Hortaea werneckii. Its clinical characte ristic is the appearance of a blackish brown macula of rapid growth, caused by the pigment produced by the fungus itself. The presence of a dark, fast growing, acral pigmentary lesion causes concern among patients and their treating physician about the possibility of a malignant pigmentary lesion. OBJECTIVE: To present a series of three clinical cases in pediatric patients with this pathology and to show the tools that help to make a differential diagnosis. CLINICAL CASES: Three patients between three and five years of age, which present a macular pigmented lesion on palms or soles, whose parents reported a rapid growth over a short period of time. Two of the patients reported previous trips to the Caribbean. Clinical and dermatoscopy suspicion of tinea nigra lead to a direct mycological exa mination, which confirmed the diagnosis. In all three cases, treatment with topical antifungals led to complete healing of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Although tinea nigra is rare in a dry climate, increasing travel of patients to tropical countries will increase the number of cases. Dermatoscopy and direct mycological examination are the tools that allow performing a correct diagnosis and avoiding unne cessary biopsies and/or surgeries.",0,1344
1360,"BACKGROUND: Pneumoperitoneum is defined as the existence of extraluminal air in the abdominal cavity. In 80-90% of cases is due to perforation of a hollow organ. However, in 10-15% of cases, it is nonsurgical pneumoperitoneum. OBJECTIVE: The case of a patient undergoing mechanical ventilation, developing abdominal compartment syndrome tension pneumoperitoneum is reported. CLINICAL CASE: Female, 75 years old asking for advise due to flu of long term duration. Given her respiratory instability, admission to the Intensive Care Unit is decided. It is then intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest x-ray revealed a large pneumoperitoneum but no pneumothorax neither mediastinum; and due to the suspicion of viscera perforation with clinical instability secondary to intra-abdominal hypertension box, emergency surgery was decided. CONCLUSIONS: When discarded medical history as a cause of pneumoperitoneum, it is considered that ventilation is the most common cause. Benign idiopathic or nonsurgical pneumoperitoneum, can be be treated conservatively if the patient agrees. But if intraabdominal hypertension prevails, it can result in severe respiratory and hemodynamic deterioration, sometimes requiring abdominal decompression to immediately get lower abdominal pressure and thus improve hemodynamic function.",0,1317

En la laparotomia quirurgica se encontro invaginacion, y se realizo desinvaginacion y reseccion del diverticulo de Meckel. Conclusion: La asociacion de diverticulo de Meckel con tejido pancreatico heterotopico en ninos es poco frecuente. Clinicamente, su principal manifestacion es la invaginacion intestinal en la literatura revisada, y el ultrasonido constituye el mejor estudio para el diagnostico de invaginacion intestinal, no asi para el diverticulo de Meckel o el tejido pancreatico heterotopico, en los que la tomografia seria una opcion.

1370,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency with an incidence of 1/200,000-250,000 live births. CGD affects mainly male patients, most of the mutations being X-linked, and autosomal recessive forms occur more frequently in communities with greater numbers of consanguineous marriages. CGD is characterized by sensitivity to recurrent and severe bacterial and fungal infections, with formation of granulomas due to the inability of phagocytes to generate reactive oxygen compounds, necessary for the intracellular death of phagocytic microorganisms. We report three cases of CGD in which Serratia marcescens was isolated, and after detailed anamnesis and performance of neutrophil function tests, a molecular diagnosis of the disease was reached. CGD can be manifested in a wide variety of ways, so that high suspicion and a meticulous anamnesis are essential to reach a diagnosis.",0,902

1374,"Pallister-Killian syndrome is caused by a tetrasomy 12p mosaicism and is characterized by facial dysmorphism, pigmentary skin anomalies, congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, epilepsy and mental retardation. The diagnosis is complex as the cytogenetic analysis in blood is usually normal, requiring karyotyping in other tissues, therefore the clinical suspicion is critical to guide the diagnostic tests and the patient requires an interdisciplinary clinical evaluation regarding the several manifestation of the syndrome. W e present the case of a Mexican mestizo female patient of 4 years of age referred by psychomotor delay and cleft palate; the clinical multidisciplinary evaluation demonstrated characteristics corresponding to the Pallister-Killian syndrome. The GTG banding karyotype analysis was normal, the skin fibroblast was mos47,XX,i(12)(p10)[85]/46,XX[21]. This case is an example of the importance of the clinical evaluation in order to establish a diagnosis that is a challenge for the clinical multidisciplinary team to offer medical management and genetic counseling.",0,1096
1375,"Introduccion: La histiocitosis de celulas de Langerhans (HCL) es un trastorno histiocitico raro y su incidencia exacta se mantiene desconocida; se ha diagnosticado en todos los grupos de edad, pero es mas comun en los primeros 3 anos de vida. Se caracteriza por lesiones unicas o multiples de tipo osteolitico causadas por proliferacion clonal de celulas histologicamente similares a las celulas de Langerhans; su presentacion clinica es heterogenea. Caso clinico: Presentamos el caso de una paciente de sexo femenino de 7 anos, con dificultad para la marcha y debilidad progresiva en los miembros inferiores de 5 dias de evolucion. A la exploracion fisica presenta hallazgos concordantes con sindrome piramidal e hipoestesias de miembros inferiores. Se realizo resonancia magnetica (RM) de columna y tomografia computarizada de craneo simple, que descarto patologia intracraneal. En la RM de columna se detecto vertebra plana con extension epidural y paravertebral, por lo que se inicio manejo con esteroides y se indico descompresion quirurgica. Se realizo reseccion parcial y biopsia de la lesion. Debido a los hallazgos histologicos y la presencia de marcadores positivos para CD1a y CD207, se confirmo el diagnostico de HCL. Conclusiones: La HCL es una enfermedad poco frecuente y de dificil diagnostico por su presentacion heterogenea. El granuloma eosinofilico y la vertebra plana como hallazgos imagenologicos pueden orientar el diagnostico, aunque siempre se debe confirmar histologicamente. Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, more common in the first three years of life. It is characterized by single or multiple osteolytic lesions due to clonal proliferation of cells histologically similar to Langerhans cells; its clinical presentation is heterogeneous. Case report: 7-year-old female patient with 5 days of progressive lower extremity weakness and difficulty to walk. Physical exam findings were consistent with pyramidal syndrome and lower extremities hypoesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine and cranial computed tomography (CT) were performed. Intracranial pathology was ruled out. The MRI findings showed vertebra plana with epidural and paravertebral involvement, so treatment with steroids and surgical decompression initiated. Partial resection and biopsy of the lesion was performed. Due to histological findings and positive CD1a and CD207 markers, diagnosis of LCH was confirmed. Conclusions: LCH is an uncommon disease with a challenging diagnosis due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Eosinophilic granuloma and vertebra plana as imaging findings may guide the diagnosis. However, it should always be confirmed with histological evidence.",0,2722
1376,"Cystic echinococcosis is a chronic parasitic zoonosis of high prevalence in Chile. We report a clinical case of a 66-year-old man, domiciled in an urban area of the Maule Region, who presents skeletal muscle cystic echinococcosis. Consultation for pain, volume increase and left thigh fistula that gives out crystalline fluid. In the study with imaging techniques, multiple cystic lesions are identified in the sacral wing, iliac bone, soft tissues of the groin and left thigh. No cysts were evident in other organs. Serology Elisa IgG was positive Echinococcus granulosus. Surgical resection of soft tissue injuries. Combined antiparasitic therapy with albendazole and praziquantel was started, with good clinical response.

1377,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel delta-thalassemia mutation causing decreased hemoglobin (Hb) A2 levels associated with Hb Watts, variant Hb resulting from a trinucleotide deletion in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Hb variant analysis was performed by cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analyses were used to identify mutations in the delta- and alpha-globin genes. RESULTS: Abnormal Hb was observed on capillary zone electrophoresis in Z6 and by cation-exchange HPLC a slower peak than HbA was observed at an retention time of 4.19min. This variant Hb is called Hb Watts [alpha2 74(EF3)Asp->0 or alpha2 75(EF4)Asp->0; HBA2:c.226_228delGAC]. The decreased HbA2 percentage owes to an insertion of 27nt between nt 83 and 84 of IVS-I of the delta-globin gene. CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing a chromatogram, the possibility of the existence of delta-thalassemia or an HbA2 variant should be considered, apart from alfa-, beta-thalassemia and structural haemoglobinopathies. To this end, each of the peaks and their percentages should be considered to allow for correct interpretation and to avoid misdiagnosis as much as possible.",0,1239
1378,Cerebral aspergillosis is a rare disease with high mortality rates in AIDS patients. It is important to take this into account in the differential diagnosis of a brain expansive lesion. A high level of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis. We present a case of an HIV-infected patient with progresive neurological disease caused by Aspergillus flavi. We review 40 previously published cases of central nervous system aspergillosis in patients with AIDS.,0,465
1379,"BACKGROUND: The desmoplastic small round cell tumour is a rare and aggressive intra-abdominal neoplasia, with only 200 cases reported, and a higher incidence in men and predilection for the second decade of life. Histologically characterized by the presence of small nests of undifferentiated tumour cells, wrapped in fibrous desmoplastic stroma. CLINICAL CASE: A 24 year old male started with abdominal pain of 4 weeks onset in the right upper quadrant, colic type, sporadic, self-limiting and accompanied by early satiety, decreased appetite, and involuntary weight loss of 10 kg in 3 months. At the time of admission the abdomen was globular, with decreased peristalsis, soft, depressible. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal-pelvic cavity. A laparotomy was performed, with a subsequent omentum resection due to the presence of multiple tumours, which microscopically were characterised by groups of small, round, blue cells, separated by a desmoplastic stroma. The immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin (> 75%), epithelial membrane antigen (> 75%), CD99 (> 50%), and S100 (25%), concluding with an abdominal tumour of small, round, blue cells as a diagnosis. Chemotherapy treatment was initiated based on IMAP plus GM-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The desmoplastic small round cell tumour is a rare neoplasia, with diagnostic complexity and a lethal course. Its clinical presentation is unspecific. Histologically, it is classified as an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that shares similar characteristics with the family of the small and blue cells tumours.",0,1609
1380,"Intramuscular myxomas are benign and rare tumors that affects predominantly the lower limbs. The association of myxomas and fibrous dysplasia, usually polyostotic, is rarer. This association is known as Mazabraud's syndrome, of which about 81 cases have been described in the literature. We present a new case of this uncommon association to emphasise the importance of recognizing this syndrome in the diagnosis and appropriate management of the patient.",0,455
1381,"CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man suffered a severe hipotension maculopathy after being kicked in his left eye. He presented a broad area of iridodialisis. Gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy and optic coherence tomography were not able to locate the suspected cyclodialysis. Medical treatment was ineffective. Five months later the patient received transcleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation with clinical resolution. DISCUSSION: Transscleral diode laser constitutes an effective treatment, with low iatrogenia, that can solve cases of ocular hypotension, even when the location of the cyclodialysis has not been determined.",0,626
1382,"Urticaria multiforme is a cutaneous disorder that affects infants and small children. It is characterized by large, annular urticarial plaques with a violaceous center and is frequently accompanied by fever. Urticaria multiforme follows a benign, self-limiting course, but the striking appearance of the lesions can cause alarm and considerable anxiety among parents. We present 5 cases of urticaria multiforme seen in our hospital over a period of 18 months. All the cases were preceded by an infection of the upper airways or otitis, and they were all empirically with amoxicillin. It is important to be familiar with this condition to reassure parents and avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and tests.",0,707
1383,"CLINICAL CASE: A 77-year-old patient had uneventful cataract surgery in the right eye under peribulbar anaesthesia. The next day, a severe and progressive eyelid swelling was noted, caused by an unknown allergic reaction to povidone-iodine. The allergic signs dissapeared by the fifth day, but amaurosis and a cherry-red spot were detected. Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography confirmed an 80% ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. DISCUSSION: Retinal vascular occlusion after orbital loco-regional anaesthesia is rare. When this complication occurs, carotid disease, and local or systemic factors, should be evaluated.",0,629
1384,"Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a rare entity that is characterised by its onset in healthy children at 2-4 years of age. It is a complex syndrome that includes, among other symptoms, rapid weight gain with hyperphagia, hypothalamic dysfunction, central hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation. The case is presented of a 10-year-old boy with a diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome undergoing insertion of a port-a-cath under general anaesthesia, who developed complications during the anaesthetic procedure related to his illness. The peri-operative management of these patients represents a challenge for the anaesthetist, given the involvement of multiple systems and the frequent respiratory comorbidities associated with them. A summary is presented of some of the implications and anaesthetic considerations that must be taken into account in the management of these patients.",0,964
1385,"INTRODUCTION: Focal tumour-like demyelinating lesions are defined as solitary demyelinating lesions with a diameter greater than 2 cm. In imaging studies, these lesions may mimic a neoplasm or brain abscess; as a result, invasive diagnostic and therapeutic measures may be performed that will in some cases increase morbidity. Our aim was to analyse and characterise these lesions according to their clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics, and this data in addition to our literature review will contribute to a better understanding of these lesions. METHODS: This descriptive study includes 5 cases with pathological diagnoses. We provide subject characteristics gathered through reviewing their clinical, radiology, and pathology reports. RESULTS: Patients' ages ranged from 12 to 60 years; 3 patients were female. The time delay between symptom onset and hospital admission was 3 to 120 days. Clinical manifestations were diverse and dependent on the location of the lesion, pyramidal signs were found in 80% of patients, there were no clinical or radiological signs of spinal cord involvement, and follow-up times ranged from 1 to 15 years. CONCLUSION: Brain biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of demyelinating tumour-like lesions; however, their clinical features, along with several magnetic resonance imaging features such as open ring enhancement, venular enhancement, the presence of glutamate in spectroscopy, and others, may be sufficient to differentiate neoplastic lesions from focal tumour-like demyelinating lesions.",0,1560
1386,"Hansen's disease (HD) is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It has a chronic course and preferentially affects the skin and the peripheral nerves. It's an emergent infection in Chile due to migration waves. This case report affecting a migrant worker from Haiti that presented several compatible skin lesions, with hypoesthesia and unilateral madarosis that appeared before arrival. The diagnosis of a multibacillary form was established by clinical findings, presence of fast acid bacilli on a direct skin smear, and inflammatory cell surrounding nerve endings and granulomas on skin biopsy. Besides, specific rpoB and hsp65 gene segments from M. leprae were amplified from skin samples. Patient was treated with the WHO standard combined regimen for multibacillary forms during one year showing partial regression of skin lesions. Nasopharyngeal samples showed the presence of M. leprae rpoB copies detected by PCR decreasing until six months of therapy. Notifiable diseases databases showed a recent increment of cases, all related to migrant population. Hansen's disease is a new condition in Chile and clinicians should be aware of this possibility. Molecular tools may facilitate diagnosis and follow up.",0,1207
1387,"BACKGROUND: The use of a new chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer is not free of complications. Monoclonal antibodies are associated with bleeding and intestinal perforations. OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient who developed a serious complication after treatment with an antiangiogenic drug for colorectal neoplasm. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 42-year-old male operated on due to subocclusive rectal cancer with metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen months after surgery during second-line adjuvant therapy, an intestinal perforation was observed with haemorrhage and intestinal leak to retroperitoneum and left lower extremity. Despite intensive medical and surgical treatment this complication had fatal consequences.

1388,"OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The aim of this study is to describe the use of botulinum toxin to increase tear retention in patients with dry eye, using the description of 2 cases. RESULTS: Patients with moderate to severe dry eye that were given an injection of type A botulinum toxin in the Horner's muscle. The results at one month and 3 months are reported. An assessment was made of the subjective perception of the patient as regards any improvement, as well as taking into account, the Ocular Surface Disease Index, superficial punctate keratitis, and the time of the tear rupture and tear meniscus. A significant improvement was observed in the subjective perception of the patient, the Ocular Surface Disease Index, superficial punctate keratitis, and the time of the tear rupture and tear meniscus at one month after treatment, and the good results still being maintained at the third month. There were no adverse events. DISCUSSION: The use of type A botulinum toxin can be considered as an alternative to increase tear retention in moderate to severe dry eye, with a good response during the first month, with an acceptable response still being maintained at the third month. Given the temporary effect of the drug, further treatments would be required.",0,1254
1389,"Stenosis of the pancreaticodigestive anastomosis (pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy) is a very rare complication that usually develops several years after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Only a few cases have been previously reported. We have reviewed the literature and present 2 more cases of pancreaticojejunostomy stenosis that started with episodes of recurrent acute pancreatitis 6 years and 1 year after PD, respectively. Diagnosis was based on symptoms of pancreatitis (12-15 episodes between 5 and 20 months after PD) and CT and MRI scans. Both patients were treated by resection of the pancreaticojejunostomy stenosis, including a 1-cm slice of pancreatic parenchyma in contact with the jejunum, followed by a new well-vascularized two-layer end-to-side PJ with external drainage of the Wirsung duct. Catheter drainage was exteriorized through a jejunal limb using the Witzel technique. Postsurgical course was uneventful in both cases, and after a follow-up period of 3 and 2.5 years, respectively, the patients remain asymptomatic but with endocrine and exocrine insufficiency. Resection of the PJ and construction of a new PJ with external stent drainage of the Wirsung duct is our preferred surgical option in the rare cases of PJ stenosis after a Whipple procedure.",0,1294
1390,"INTRODUCTION: Spondylotic myelopathy is the commonest cause of nontraumatic myelopathy. Radiological features of spondylotic myelopathy can often overlap with inflammatory myelopathies which may lead to a delayed or incorrect diagnosis and therapy. A distinctive gadolinium enhancement pattern recently described may help to differentiate spondylotic from inflammatory myelopathy. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: a 38-years-old man presented with a 2-year history of paresthesias in the upper extremities, and one year later cramps on the right limbs and numbness over right C5 and C6 dermatomes, related to movement of the neck. Case 2: a 44-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of progressive gait difficulties and sensory disturbance in the hands, and a recent onset of bladder dysfunction. In both cases, spinal cord MRI identified a longitudinal cervical T2-signal hyperintensity associated with a pancakelike transverse band of gadolinium enhancement just below the site of maximum spinal stenosis, and circumferential or hemicord enhancement on axial images. CONCLUSIONS: The radiological features of spondylotic myelopathy may resemble those of inflammatory origin. The recognition of a transverse pancakelike gadolinium enhancement immediately below the site of maximal compression as a typical radiological pattern of spondylotic myelopathy is important to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and to help in the management of these patients.",0,1445
1391,"Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is a benign vascular proliferation characterized by solitary or multiple angiomatous lesions. It is most common in young or middle-aged women, and the lesions typically affect the head and neck, showing a particular predilection for the periauricular region. The differential diagnosis in patients with ALHE is broad and includes both benign and malignant conditions. We report on a series of cases of periauricular ALHE in which ultrasound imaging revealed an hypervascular, pseudonodular and plaque-like morphology with clinical and histologic correlations. It also evidenced vascular communication between lesions that appeared to be separate on clinical examination. Familiarity with such ultrasound presentations could help to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate disease monitoring in patients with ALHE.",0,867
1392,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery is well accepted as a safe technique when performed on a third trimester pregnant woman. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to describe the anaesthetic management of a group of patients undergoing this type of surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An analysis was made of records of 6 patients in their third trimester of pregnancy and who underwent urgent laparoscopic surgery from 2011 to 2013. CLINICAL CASES: The study included 6 patients, with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in 4 of them. The other 2 patients had acute appendicitis, both of who presented threatened preterm labour. CONCLUSION: The most frequent indications for laparoscopic surgery during the last trimester of birth were found to be acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is related to an elevated risk of presenting threatened preterm labour.",0,858
1393,"INTRODUCTION: Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are due to mutations in the PEX genes, which code for peroxins that are required for peroxisomal biogenesis. Clinically, they are expressed as a Zellweger syndrome spectrum, and there is a wide phenotypic variety. They are diagnosed biochemically, and confirmation is molecular. The aim of this illustrative case is to highlight the importance of the clinical features and biochemical testing in the management of a peroxisomal disease. CASE REPORT: A 3-year-old boy with neonatal hypotonia, overall developmental delay and failure to thrive and a pattern of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy in brain resonance. The suspected diagnosis was a disorder affecting the biogenesis of the peroxisomes due to having found a variant with an uncertain meaning in PEX5. The clinical features, the biochemical studies and critical analysis, however, made this diagnosis unlikely. Emphasis is placed on the management that must be applied when a Zellweger syndrome spectrum is suspected. CONCLUSION: In the case reported here, a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder was suspected owing to an exome sequencing which, on being critically analysed together with the clinical features and the biochemical findings, made a peroxisomal disease very unlikely. In cases of clinical suspicion, backed up by neuroimaging, the main diagnostic management must be based on the biochemistry analysis. Although confirmation is molecular, these tests must be interpreted with caution.",0,1496
1394,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal infarction accounts for 1% of all strokes. Cardioembolism is a rare cause. Common areas of ischemic spinal damage are watershed in the dorsal or lumbar regions; however cervical spinal cord infarction has been reported previously. CASE REPORT: We present a new case of a man-in-the-barrel syndrome produced by cardiac embolization associated with atrial fibrillation during an acute myocardial infarction, which caused cervical ischemic neuronopathy (infarction of the anterior horn). CONCLUSIONS: Classic features of cervical spinal cord ischemia are acute tetraplegia, bladder, bowel and cardiovascular dysfunction and dissociate sensory loss. Incomplete collateralization and anatomical characteristics of the circulation of the anterior spinal artery in the cervical spinal cord, makes of the portion C3 to C5, the most vulnerable portion to ischemic damage, since the radicular arteries supply begins bellow C5 and the pathophysiology of a fast fresh clot lysis produced unique bilateral neuronal horn cells damage.",0,1041
1395,"The dermatological manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis present in about 17% of the cases, is a challenge for its diagnosis. We report the case of a patient from the northern coast of Peru, who presented diffuse dermal lesions, erythema-violaceous nodules, and ulcers histopathologically compatible with the infection of the genus Histoplasma var. capsulatum.",0,368
1396,"Anti-N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr) encephalitis is a recently described clinical entity with an increasing number of reported cases. Psychiatric symptoms in the early stages of the disease constitute a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. We present two clinical cases: clinical case 1, a 26-year-old man, and clinical case 2, an 18-year-old man; both presented with a first episode of psychosis and were hospitalized as psychiatric disorders. Subsequently, both cases were diagnosed as anti-NMDAr encephalitis. The high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in anti-NMDAr encephalitis forces psychiatrists and neurologists to have a high degree of suspicion in the presence of atypical symptoms in patients evaluated for the first episode of psychosis.",0,770
1397,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 39 year-old man with a combined hamartoma of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, who experienced progressive visual loss and worsening of metamorphopsia. The patient underwent vitrectomy and epiretinal component peeling, with improvement in visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and retinal architecture, assessed by optical coherence tomography.

1398,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic infection with high mortality that is caused by species of Mucorales. The most common species involved are Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia, and Rhizomucor. CASE REPORT: A 56 year-old woman presented with a clinical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic renal disease. She underwent a cadaveric kidney transplantation two years before her admission, for which immunomodulating therapy with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mofetil-microphenolate and prednisone was established. The patient suffered a pneumonic process with cough, expectoration, and dyspnoea. The computed tomography scan showed a cavitation in the right upper lobe. With all these findings an invasive broncopulmonary aspergillosis was suspected and the patient began an antifungal treatment with voriconazole without improvement. Rhizomucor pusillus was isolated from a clinical specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration, and its identification was confirmed by PCR. After this finding amphotericin B was administered, but the patient had an uncontrolled haemoptysis and died. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare infection, usually fatal in kidney transplant recipients with anti-rejection therapy. Mucorales species usually produce thrombotic phenomena, associated with necrosis and parenchymal destruction that caused a fatal uncontrolled haemoptysis in our patient. Early diagnosis is important in order to perform any surgical treatment and to administer amphotericin B.",0,1514
1399,"Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterized by pathologic expansion and activation of mast cells. The main clinical manifestations of SM include skin involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms and anaphylaxis due to the release of its mediators. Thirty percent of pat ients with SM have a low bone mass and 20% fractures. At the same time, SM affects 10% of male patients with idiopathic osteoporosis. Measuring serum tryptase is essential for the screening of MS. We report two cases of SM with bone involvement. A 25-year- old woman with prior diagnosis of SM, based on skin involvement, flushing, high serum tryptase and compatible bone marrow (BM) biopsy and genetic study. Low bone mass was diagnosed and treatment was started with calcium and vitamin D plus oral bisphosphona tes with adequate response. A 47 years old man who presented with multiple osteoporotic vertebral fractures and low bone mass. Treatment with vitamin D and alendronate was started, but the patient developed new vertebral fractures. The study was extended w ith measurement of serum tryptase that was elevated. Diagnosis of SM was confirmed with BM biopsy and the patient was referred to hematology for specific care. These cases emphasize the importance of bone assessment in SM, as well as the need to rule out S M in patients with osteoporosis and no evident cause.",0,1345
1400,"INTRODUCTION: Despite screening for latent tuberculosis (TB), new cases of TB infection are detected in patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha and negative initial screening, some of them after long treatment, which points more to a new infection. OBJECTIVES: To describe the cases that have presumably developed a primary tuberculous infection during treatment with anti-TNF-alpha drugs. METHODS: Retrospective audit (1999-2012). Inclusion criteria were: a) anti-TNF-alpha treatment; b) initial latent TB screening negative; c) TB diagnosed during anti-TNF-alpha treatment; d) suspected primary TB infection (diagnosis after at least 12 months on anti-TNF-alpha). Clinical, epidemiological, therapeutic and outcome variables were reviewed. RESULTS: Two cases of primary TB infection were found out of of 771 anti-TNF-alpha treated patients (0.2%). One woman aged 41 suffered TB pneumonia after 35 months of treatment with adalimumab, and a male aged 37 who developed disseminated TB after 107 months of treatment with infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, during TNF antagonist therapy, TB risk persists despite negative initial screening, so clinicians should be aware of TB during the entire treatment.",0,1209
1401,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital glioblastoma multiforme represents only 3% of congenital central nervous system tumours and an infratentorial location is unusual. CASE REPORT: A newborn with congenital glioblastoma multiforme with no mutation in the TP53 gene or p53 nuclear immunoreactivity that infiltrated practically the whole brainstem and also invaded supratentorial structures. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, only four cases with an infratentorial location have been reported previously, three in the cerebellum and one in the brainstem. The biology of congenital glioblastoma multiforme is not well known and, unlike glioblastoma multiforme in adults and children, mutations in the TP53 gene are uncommon. However, this is not associated with a more favourable prognosis. These observations suggest that specific biological processes underlie fetal glioblastoma multiforme development.",0,887
1402,"We report a 59-year-old man with a history of hypertension, recurrent renal stones and a severe hypercalcemia of 14.9 mg/dl with a serum phosphorus of 2.4 mg/dl and a serum albumin of 3.6 g/dl. Physical examination showed a 4 cm left cervical nodule, consistent with the diagnosis of thyroid nodule. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 844 pg/mL (normal 15-65 pg/ml) and a cervical ultrasound examination disclosed a solid nodule in the lower left lobe of 40 x 30 x 25 mm, adjacent to the thyroid parenchyma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral renal stones. Parathyroid scintigraphy showed a high uptake of the left lower parathyroid mass and a bone densitometry showed bone density t scores of -1.2 in the spine, -2.0 in the right femoral neck and -3.5 in the distal radius. A review of his medical record revealed the presence of hypercalcemia for at least 4 years. He was admitted for hydration and administration of 4 mg zoledronic acid iv. At 24 hours, serum calcium dropped to 11.0 mg/dl, and a left thyroid lobectomy was performed including the lower left parathyroid gland. The pathology report showed a 22.6 g parathyroid adenoma. Intraoperatory PTH descended > 50%, consistent with successful parathyroidectomy. At 7 days after surgery serum calcium was 8.8 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.1 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 166 U/L, albumin 3.9 g/dL, PTH 230 pg/ml and 25-OH vitamin D 12.4 ng/ml. This finding was interpreted as secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency and ""hungry bone"", being less likely the presence of residual or metastatic parathyroid tissue. A cholecalciferol load was administered, with significant descent of PTH.",0,1657
1403,"This is a case report of a 96 year old woman with pain and functional impotence in her left hip after fall. X rays were performed and loosening of the acetabular component was appreciated. After discussion of treatment options, it was decided to cement an acetabular component for a double mobility head. There was a high rate of medical and surgical complications in revision of hip arthroplasty in elderly patients. However, it can also offer important benefits in terms of independence and quality of life and even increase life expectancy in patients with less comorbidity. In our case after six months of follow-up the patient was able to walk alone using a walker. In the literature review, age does not appear as a limit for the surgical indication. Preoperative medical optimization of the patient as well as shorter operative time and blood loss, are important factors for good results of these cases.",0,910
1404,"Granuloma annulare is a benign and self-limited cutaneous disease. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is an uncommon variant seen almost exclusively in young children, characterized by firm nodules appearing more frequently in lower extremities, buttocks, hands and scalp. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of subcutaneous granuloma annulare and review its differential diagnoses and treatments. CLINICAL CASE: A 4 year-old male patient. Since 2 and a half years of age he presented asymptomatic firm subcutaneous nodules on the back of the left middle finger and later on the back of the left hand, right big toe, left frontal area and scalp. Excisional biopsy of some lesions from the scalp was consistent with subcutaneous granuloma annulare. Clobetasol 0,05% cream twice a day for 1 month was prescribed without response. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous granuloma annulare must be considered within the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous nodules in children. In most of the cases a biopsy and histopathology of the lesions will be required to confirm the diagnosis. Due to its tendency to spontaneous resolution, treatment often is not necessary and periodic evaluation is recommended.",0,1178
1405,"BACKGROUND: Wilkie syndrome, also referred as superior mesenteric artery syndrome, is an unusual cause of a proximal small bowel obstruction. It is characterised by the compression of the duodenum in its third portion due to a narrowing of the space between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. Its presentation symptoms are consistent and include the obstruction of the proximal small bowel. However, the physical and laboratory findings are non-specific. Nevertheless, many imaging methods are useful for its diagnosis. The management of this condition varies between observation and surgery, depending on each particular case. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 19 year-old male who began with acute, intense abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. On examination, he had abdominal wall rigidity and hyperesthesia. Imaging studies were requested, revealing a decreased superior mesenteric artery angle, a shortening of the aortic mesenteric distance, and a decrease in the calibre of the third duodenal portion, all findings concomitant with Wilkie syndrome. Conservative treatment was applied and the patient was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Wilkie syndrome continues to be an unknown condition to the general practitioner, and the underdiagnosis of this condition may put a patient at risk of serious complications. A high index of suspicion is required to reach a diagnosis. Early treatment should give a good outcome most of the time.",0,1484
1406,"INTRODUCTION: Traumatic dislocation of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT) has a very low prevalence. It presents with pain and recurrent snapping on the posterior side of the medial malleolus after an ankle sprain while practicing sports. The diagnosis is based on clinical examination, supported by imaging techniques. The treatment must be always surgical. CASE REPORT: A 28 year old man sprained ankle his ankle while jogging. He was treated in an emergency department with an elastic bandage. Once he recovered, he went back to running, noticing a projection with ankle pain. In the physical examination the PTT was reproduced with inversion maneuvers and forced dorsiflexion. Ultrasound and MRI were performed on the ankle. The patient was operated on, leaving a stable ankle with no projection. Three months later he had no pain and restarted his physical activities. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of PTT dislocation by re-anchoring the flexor retinacula provides an excellent functional outcome.",0,1002
1407,"Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome is a disease caused by complement regulation abnormalities that generally progresses to chronic end-stage renal disease with a high rate of recurrence in kidney transplantation and a high risk of graft loss. Anti-complement therapy has improved the prognosis of these patients, achieving disease remission in most cases, increasing the likelihood of a successful kidney transplant and increasing patient and graft survival. Drugs with low risk of induction of thrombotic microangiopathies such as belatacept and mycophenolate have also been used with satisfactory results. We present the case of a young patient at high immunological risk, with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome due to factor H mutation, who underwent a successful kidney transplantation with eculizumab, thymoglobulin, belatacept, mycophenolate and steroids, to date preserving excellent graft function without disease recurrence.",0,937
1408,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache is an uncommon disease that resolves spontaneously in most of the cases and in a short period of time. The initial treatment should be symptomatic. In some patients the symptomatology is extremely disabling, and in these cases both the diagnosis and treatment may be performed by an epidural blood patch. A 49-year-old Caucasian woman, with no previous record of epidural or intrathecal puncture, consulted in the Emergency Department complaining of a 9-day history of frontal headache and diplopia, along with nausea and vomiting. The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache. Considering the symptomatology and the uncontrolled pain, the Pain Unit of our hospital performed an epidural blood patch. In the first 24h the patient reported a remarkable relief of both headache and diplopia but developed a left lumbar radiculopathy that was treated successfully with supportive measures. Transient lumbar radiculopathy is a common and acceptable event secondary to the use of epidural blood patch as a treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache.",0,1139
1409,"Bifidobacterium scardovii species consists of facultative anaerobic gram-positive rods whose growth is stimulated by CO2 and anaerobiosis. Exceptionally it has been associated with infections in humans. An elderly male patient with a urinary tract infection due to B. scardovii and Enterococcus faecalis is presented here; both microorganisms were isolated from two consecutive urine samples. The bacillus did not grow on standard media, but on chocolate agar incubated in CO2 and on supplemented Brucella agar in an anaerobic atmosphere, incubated for 72h at 35 degrees C. Gram staining with abundant irregular gram-positive rods with Y-shaped ends and some gram-positive cocci alerted to its presence. The importance of the Gram stain test in urine samples with pyuria and the growth on enriched media for long periods is highlighted here. In this case, if we had not had the Gram stain test results, and had considered only the E. faecalis growth, we would have lost the major etiologic agent.",0,996
1410,"Mycobacterium scrofulaceum is a slow-growing atypical mycobacteria with a reservoir in the environmen, and occasionally it causes disease in humans. The case of a 10-year-old patient with fever of four months of evolution is presented. Symptoms include bilateral adenopathies of neck, thorax, abdomen and inguinal region, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting; in addition, a positive serology for EBV and a culture of the left inguinal ganglia with growth of M. scrofulaceum were evidenced. Thus, this is the first report of human infection caused by the aforementioned mycobacterium in Ecuador, which it was particularly manifested with an unusual pattern of resistance.",0,668
1411,"CASE REPORT: A case is presented of an 85 year-old Caucasian female with lymphoma that recurred in the orbit (secondary ocular adnexal lymphoma). The orbital tumour was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the REAL classification (Revised European-American Lymphoma Classification). DISCUSSION: Orbital lymphomas are predominantly B-cell proliferations of a variety of histological types, and most are low-grade tumours. Patients are usually middle-aged or elderly, and it is slightly more common in women. A palpable mass, proptosis and blepharoptosis are the most common signs of presentation.",0,603
1412,"Tuberculosis (tb) of the chest wall is uncommon and it represents less than 5% of all cases of musculoskeletal tb and only 1-2% of tb. We present the case of an elderly woman with tb of the chest wall secondary to a nodal tb with an unusual presentation. The diagnosis of this entity is difficult because the disease often mimics other diseases such as pyogenic abscess, chest wall.",0,382
1413,"A 63-year-old male patient with a history of stent implantation in the left anterior descending three months before. Due to the presentation of vegetative symptoms, he was referred for gated-SPECT myocardial perfusion. During acquisition of the resting images he presented chest pain and ST segment elevation, so that urgent cardiac catheterization was performed, showing stent thrombosis. Rest perfusion imaging showed a defect in anterior and apical perfusion, more severe and extensive than in the stress images, with striking left ventricular dilatation and a fall in the ejection fraction related to the acute ischemia phenomenon. Intense exercise is associated with a transient activation of the coagulation system and hemodynamic changes that might induce thrombosis, especially in recently implanted coronary stents that probably still have not become completely endothelialized.",0,887
1414,"Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis, or Caffey-Silverman disease, is a rare condition characterised by generalised bone proliferation mediated by an acute inflammatory process. Diagnosis can be made through clinical evaluation and X-ray studies. The course is generally self-limiting and prognosis is excellent. OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a 4-month child with clinical and radiological symptoms compatible with Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis. CASE REPORT: A 4-month old male who presented with crying and irritability associated with swelling of the face, arms and legs was admitted to the Emergency Room of National Institute of Pediatrics. Bilateral mandibular swelling extending to periauricular region was observed, with no signs of inflammation. X-ray studies showed a periosteal reaction in the jaw, left femur and tibia, and radius bilateral. Clinical observation combined with analgesics and antipyretics was the only medical intervention. Four to six months after discharge from hospital, the symptoms disappeared, confirming the good prognosis of this condition. CONCLUSION: Infantile cortical hyperostosis is a collagenopathy, which must be considered as a differential diagnosis in acute bone inflammatory processes, irritability and fever. It is important to understand and identify this disease and clinical-radiological correlation is remarkable.",0,1365
1415,"Liquefied hydrocarbon gas, such as propane is considered safe. However there are reports that voluntary exposure to liquefied gas at least could originate hallucinatory states. We report a 20 years old woman who was found in a coma with extensor muscle hypertonia, brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar (Babinski) responses after being exposed to propane gas. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions in both hippocampi and white matter in the oval center. The patient had a normal oxygen saturation of 98%, a carboxyhemoglobin of 1.6% and a metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.01 with an anion gap of 16 mEq/l. This pattern suggested that it was a consequence of the intermediary metabolism of isopropanol. The recovery of the patient was slow and four months later she still had lesions on MRI and limitations in her cognitive sphere, memory and executive functions. Thus, liquefied gas exposure can cause a toxic encephalopathy with a persistent damage of the central nervous system.",0,1006
1416,"Ureterocele is a relatively common malformation of the urinary system in children; however, the ureterocele prolapse through the urethra is an extremely rare presentation. Urological nuclear magnetic resonance is the test of choice for definitive diagnosis. Initial treatment of a prolapsed ureterocele involves decompression of the mass. We report the case of a 7-month-old infant with duplication of the collecting system and right ectopic ureterocele appearing as a vulvar mass.",0,481
1417,"CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman, with unremarkable past medical history, who presented with acute visual loss in her left eye due to bilateral posterior uveitis. After the screening, she was diagnosed with acute syphilitic placoid chorioretinitis and was treated with intravenous penicillin. DISCUSSION: Clinical manifestations of ocular syphilis are extremely heterogeneous and may mimic several aetiologies. Anti-treponema treatment usually induces a quick and positive response in affected patients. Prompt and proper diagnosis of these patients is crucial, although anatomical and functional damage may persist.",0,640
1418,"It isn't every day that a doctor becomes a patient. It is more peculiar when it occurs with an unknown mysterious epidemic respiratory illness that kills. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) gripped the world in 2003, spreading via air-links and throwing the global economy into disarray. As a practicing physician in Singapore, one of the first countries affected, I describe my first-hand account of my battle with this illness, how I acquired this illness in Singapore, and eventually quarantine in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.",1,534
1419,"An unusual case is presented of a 29 year-old Caucasian woman with a granuloma in an old scar in the right periocular region as a first clinical sign of a systemic sarcoidosis. An excisional biopsy was performed, for which the histological diagnosis was a chronic non-necrotising granulomatous inflammation, suggestive of scar sarcoidosis. The lesion re-appeared one year after initial treatment, and was treated with intralesional depot steroids, showing adequate progression. This disease occurs more frequently in wound areas where there are foreign bodies and could be the first sign of systemic sarcoidosis.",0,612
1420,"CASE REPORT: 78 year-old female patient being investigated for a left orbital pseudotumour of 17 days onset. She had proptosis, pain, with no limitation of eye movements, periorbital oedema, and upper eyelid ptosis, compatible with an orbital pseudotumour. The MRI showed an upper outer left orbital mass adjacent to the side of eyeball and an increase in soft tissue at the level of lacrimal gland. The histopathology study of an eyelid lesion demonstrated the presence of non-caseating granulomas. DISCUSSION: A definitive diagnosis of orbital sarcoidosis was made. Oral treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate achieved gradual control of the disease.",0,661
1421,"INTRODUCTION: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a reduction of the size of the cerebellum and pons secondary to an alteration in its development, and can be caused by neurodegenerative diseases of genetic origin, of which there are known 10 subtypes (PCH 1-10), cortical malformations, metabolic and genetic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a child with microcephaly, PCH and West syndrome, in which the genetic study allowed to make the diagnosis of a deletion on chromosome X. CASE REPORT: This is a female infant of 7-month at diagnosis, without family or obstetric history of interest, head circumference at birth -1.5 standard deviations (SD). She had little weight and growth in head circumference progression. In addition, physical examination revealed no fixating gaze, hypotonia with preserved deep tendon reflexes. Progressively developed refractary seizures. Brainsteam Auditory Evoked Potential demonstrated involvement of pontomesencefphalic ways and neuroimaging Pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genetic study (aCGH) showed heterozygous deletion on the X chromosome, affecting the CASK gene. CONCLUSIONS: Given the wide differential diagnosis proposed at the PCH, new cytogenetic techniques have improved the classification of HPC and in some cases establish their etiology, so in these cases can provide appropriate genetic counseling to families.",0,1374
1422,"Hypertrichosis cubiti is a localized increase in hair density, length and thickness. It is an uncommon and benign entity with very few patients described in the medical literature (more or less than half a hundred). Half of the described patients associate other defects or malformations and the other half are purely aesthetic cases. Early pubarche in girls is defined as the onset of pubic hair before 8 years of age. We present a six-year-old patient with the association not previously described of hypertrichosis cubiti and precocious pubarche.",0,549
1423,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease with a significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory failure is the major complication, and patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Health care workers are particularly vulnerable to SARS. SARS has the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission. There is currently no proven effective treatment of SARS, so early recognition, isolation, and stringent infection control are the key to controlling this highly contagious disease. Horseshoe bats are implicated in the emergence of novel coronavirus infection in humans. Further studies are needed to examine host genetic markers that may predict clinical outcome.",1,731
1424,"INTRODUCTION: Acute cerebellitis is one of the main causes of cerebellar syndrome in infancy. Among the wide range of manifestations, headache and ataxia being the most predominant, we can find other less frequent, although nonetheless interesting, ones, such as language disorders, which go beyond the well-known cerebellar dysarthria. The different combinations in which the symptoms can appear, especially when not accompanied by ataxia, make the condition a real challenge for the clinician. CASE REPORTS: Two patients, aged 2 and 4 years, with clinical features, lab tests and neuroimaging results consistent with parainfectious acute cerebellitis. Both of them also presented a striking language disorder, one in the form of cerebellar mutism and the other in the form of hypofluency and agrammatism, the latter also developing in the absence of ataxia. Both cases progressed favourably, and mild speech alterations persisted in the follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS: Cases such as these expand the range of clinical manifestations of acute cerebellitis. The involvement of the cerebellum in neurocognitive processes like language is becoming increasingly more important and, although many aspects are still only speculations, managing to define its true role will have important repercussions on the diagnosis, treatment and long-term prognosis of these patients.",0,1366
1425,"Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis in children. Vasculitic processes can involve the lung. Although diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may be seen as one of the manifestation of HSP, it is not a frequent presentation. Here we reported the case of a 10-year-old girl with HSP nephritis who developed pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient was treated successfully with intravenous methylprednisolone. A review of the literature revealed that young age may be a good prognostic sign and that immunosuppressive drugs and supportive management are essential in the treatment.",0,585
1426,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the outcome of tibial bone neo formation, using induced-membrane technique and non-vascularized ipsolateral fibular graft transposition. CASE REPORT: A 25 years old male with a 2 years ago firearm injury in left leg, presenting an initial diagnosis of open fracture Gustilo IIIB AO 42C3 IO4NV1MT2 with a 7cm tibial diaphyseal bone defect. During his hospital evolution multiple interventions were made including surgical debridement and skin grafts placement, with unfavorable results. Therefore, we decided to use the induced-membrane technique and non-vascularized ipsolateral fibular graft transposition, resulting in a cane dependent ambulation, in 4 months evolution after last intervention. CONCLUSION: Induced-membrane technique and non-vascularized ipsolateral fibular graft transposition could be a successful alternative for the management of patients with severe bone loss.",0,910
1427,"CASE PRESENTATION: An 81 year-old woman and a 63 year-old man developed a pre-Descemet haematoma after deep sclerectomy (DS), the former during the surgery itself and the latter during the early post-operative period. The surgical technique is decribed that led to the evacuation of the haematoma and the preservation of the integrity of trabeculo-Descemet membrane. The anterior-segment OCT findings after surgery are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first reported cases of pre-Descemet haematoma after DS that have been successfully repaired by an ab interno Descemet membranotomy. Surgeons should be aware of this rare, but potentially sight-threatening, complication.",0,682
1428,"Hydatidosis is a zoonotic infection that can invade many organs in the human being. Nevertheless, the subcutaneous tissue is the less affected organ by this disease. When this disease appears, little symptomatology is observed, which causes prolonged periods of disease associated to delayed diagnosis and a poor answer to the antiparasitic therapy. The central mountain range of Peru is the geographical zone with the greatest prevalence, presumably due to the inadequate measures of environmental sanitation, the lack of education and the almost non-existent control measures of the disease. With the aim to discuss the problems related to the subcutaneous location and its probable physiopathology, this study reports two cases of subcutaneous hydatidosis that appeared with tumor lesions with a prolonged evolution and that did not affect the liver or the lungs and which were finally treated by means of surgical removal due to the lack of response to treatment with albendazol.",0,983
1429,"About one third of focal thyroid uptakes in a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) study are malignant, the most frequent histological type being papillary carcinoma. Metastases to the thyroid account for approximately 7.5% of thyroid malignancies and come mainly from kidney, lung, head and neck, and breast cancers. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman presenting a fast growing thyroid nodule whose primitive or metastatic origin was not obvious, for which (18)F-FDG PET/CT helped in the diagnostic process and in the later management of the patient. Histopathologic findings finally revealed a metastasis of uterine leiomyosarcoma.",0,690
1430,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic iliacus muscle injury is rare; it is usually caused by trauma or intense exercise involving the pelvic girdle; it can produce a hematoma with femoral nerve neuropathy. Spontaneous muscle hematomas occur in patients with coagulation disorders. CLINICAL CASE: A 45-year-old male with 18 days of evolution, with an intense pain in the right buttock, groin and iliac fossa, with an inability for hip flexion and ambulation caused by inadequate exercise (supine double leg lifts). On the physical examination: intense pain with bending and/or internal rotation of the right hip, positive Thomas maneuver, quadriceps rated 3/5; area of paresthesia in the right femoral nerve territory. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed: right iliacus muscle tear with blood between its fibers. Initial treatment was rest and analgesics for eight days and gradual extension of the hip, axillary crutches with partial weight bearing and diathermy on the right abdominal lower quadrant, active hip exercises, bicycle and right quadriceps strengthening. The evolution was satisfactory, with full recovery in six weeks.",0,1121
1431,"The saccular aneurysm of the azygos vein is an extremely rare condition, which when located in the path of an accesory pulmonary fissure, becomes a diagnostic challenge because it can be mistaken for tumors arising from the accesory pleura, like solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura or mesothelioma. The diagnosis should ideally be done by non-invasive methods such as CT or MR angiographic technique in multiple phases, thus avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention. This case is exceptional because, to our knowledge, it is the first to report both concomitant clinical situations, an aneurysm of the azygos vein in the pathway of its accessory fissure.",0,657
1432,"BACKGROUND: The rare incidence of primary malignant melanoma of the central nervous system and its ability to mimic other melanocytic tumors on images makes it a diagnostic challenge for the neurosurgeon. CLINICAL CASE: A 51-year-old patient, with a tumor located in the right forniceal callosum area. Total surgical excision was performed. Histopathological result was consistent with the diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma of the central nervous system, after ruling out extra cranial and extra spinal melanocytic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The primary malignant melanoma of the central nervous system is extremely rare. There are features in magnetic resonance imaging that increase the diagnostic suspicion; nevertheless there are other tumors with more prevalence that share some of these features through image. Since there is not an established therapeutic standard its prognosis is discouraging.",0,903
1433,"OBJECTIVE: To contribute to the literature with three unusual cases of primary breast tumor with metastasis to the urinary bladder. METHODS: Presentation of the three clinical cases and bibliographic review. RESULTS: Three women, with an average age of 49.3 years, were diagnosed with invasive lobular breast carcinoma. Two of them suffered from hematuria after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The third patient was diagnosed incidentally after a routine CT scan. Upon diagnosis of the bladder metastases, they already had metastasis in other locations. The treatment of the three cases was palliative. The cause of death was due to additional pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of bladder metastases due to breast cancer is infrequent. The appearance of urinary tract symptoms in these patients requires a diagnostic study in order to rule out metastases.",0,864
1434,"INTRODUCTION: The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is an infrequent benign neoplasm with unpredictable cli nical behavior. OBJECTIVES: to describe three clinical cases at the San Borja Arriaran Clinical Hospital between March 2014 and January 2018 and to carry out an updated review of the literature. Case 1: 14-year-old male adolescent, hospitalized due to abdominal pain, diagnosed with jejunojejunal intus susception secondary to an intestinal wall tumor. The histology was compatible with an inflamma tory myofibroblastic tumor. Case 2: 12-year-old female adolescent, hospitalized due to pneumonia and low-back pain under study associated with weight loss. A retroperitoneal mass was diagnosed involving the right psoas muscle, paravertebral muscles, vertebrae, right kidney, and ipsilateral dia phragm. A puncture biopsy was performed and the result was compatible with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Case 3: 11-year-old female pre-adolescent, hospitalized to study recurrent urinary tract infection. A bladder tumor was identified, and the biopsy showed compatibility with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. CONCLUSION: Due to the variable behavior of the inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, its management will depend on the location, expression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), tumor behavior, and the resection possibility.",0,1352
1435,"Botulism is an important public health problem in Argentina. It is a potentially fatal disease, and its diagnosis may be difficult. There are rare presentation forms of the disease, such as acute abdomen. We present a 4-month baby with a 3-day constipation condition, associated with weakness and abnormal eating attitude in the last 12 hours. The baby presented preserved muscle tone, with no changes in sucking or deglutition according to the mother's observations. Altered sensorium and acute abdomen were found; the patient was entered into the operating room with presumptive diagnosis of intussusception, which was confirmed by pneumatic desinvagination. During hospitalization, the patient did not make good progress and presented weak cry, progressive hypotonia and respiratory failure requiring intensive care. Clostridium botulinum was isolated from the stool sample and botulinum toxin type A was isolated from serum. The patient was treated with equine botulinum toxin. Twenty five days after admission, he was totally recovered.",0,1041
1436,"The erector spinae plane block is a technique recently described by Forero et al. in September 2016. It has applications in the control of chronic pain with neuropathic component of the chest wall, and for pain control in thoracoscopic surgery. In this article, we describe the use of this technique as part of a multimodal analgesic approach in a 40-year-old woman, who underwent radical mastectomy due to breast cancer. By performing this block before anesthetic induction, we have achieved an opioid sparing effect, avoiding a possible immunomodulatory effect, although not yet proven in humans. During hospitalization, the patient reported no pain (0/10 in numeric scale), without resorting to rescue analgesia. The easy, fast and safe execution of erector spinae plane block makes it a promising technique in the context of surgical pain during radical mastectomy.",0,869
1437,"Ascaris lumbricoides is considered the largest intestinal nematode with a higher incidence in the childhood, representing a truly medical and public health problem, principally in undeveloped countries. We present the case of an 83 year old man, born and coming from the amazon region, without any relevant previous history of disease, admitted in the emergency department of our hospital for presenting intestinal obstruction and also presumptive biliary obstruction due to multiple balls of parasites, requiring immediate surgical intervention. We emphasize the need of consider this etiologic possibility in the differential diagnosis, that in this particular case, wasn't suspected in the first place.",0,705
1438,"OBJETIVE: To describe the adult type granulosa cell testicular tumors (classified as sex cordstromal tumor) due to their behavior, hardly known with a small number of cases reported. METHOD: We report a new case of a 59-year-old man presenting an adult type granulosa cell tumor of the testis (AGCTT), painless, with a 3.3 centimeter intratesticular heterogeneous mass on ultrasound, with solid and cystic areas. Serum tumor markers and extension study were negative. RESULTS: Histologic and inmunohistochemical studies confirmed an AGCTT, similar to its ovarian counterpart. CONCLUSION: AGCTT are rare neoplasms with unpredictable behavior. Their metastatic potential has been described, reason why they need a long follow-up; however, they usually have a good prognosis.",0,772
1439,"Severe skin reactions include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Drug reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, which are uncommon in the pediatric population (incidence 1/1000- 10 000 children), but they have bad prognosis. Drug-sensitive Syndrome with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms consists in rash, hematological abnormalities, lymphadenopathy and organ involvement. We report the case of a 12-year-old male patient who developed this pathology after initiating anticonvulsant therapy with carbamazepine. We consider that it is important to be aware of this disease and to include it among the differential diagnoses in patients with similar conditions because this syndrome is life-threatening.",0,750
1440,"CASE REPORT: A 70 year-old male patient with a history of radial keratotomy suffering from Fuchs' dystrophy and a cataract. The patient received a two-step surgery: lens phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implant, followed by descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty in both eyes, four months later. There were no complications apart from a recurrent cystoid macular oedema in both eyes. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/40 both eyes, and the patient was satisfied. DISCUSSION: Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty may be considered as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty in the case of endothelial dysfunction and radial keratotomy in patients with no corneal ectasia or significant stromal opacity.",0,750
1441,"CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with malaria with neurological involvement. Two months later he referred metamorphopsia in the left eye. Malarial retinopathy was observed in the fundus examination. The Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the macula showed parafoveal pigment epithelium detachment (DEP). Specific anti-malarial treatment was initiated, with the disappearance of the retinopathy being observed. DISCUSSION: Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the retinopathy in neurological malaria. A funduscopic examination and macular OCT should be performed in these patients, as it is associated with a higher mortality when there is a retinal involvement.",0,678
1442,"INTRODUCTION: Tetanus is an acute disease caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetanii. The disease can affect people of any age, and the fatality rate is high. Thanks to immunization the number of cases of the disease has decreased, although they are still present in isolation in countries with social and economic backwardness. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of a pediatric patient with generalized tetanus to reinforce the relevance of prophylaxis and early detection. CASE REPORT: 6 years old female patient, with only one dose of pentavalent vaccine, 10 days after sharps injury by wood chips, starts with fever, muscle pain and generalized contractions, Tetanus was diagnosed by clinical symptoms and history. The management was based on the latest recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO): Penicillin-Metronidazole antibiotic regimen, tetanus toxoid and tetanus high-dose gammaglobulin. After 2 years of follow-up under physiotherapy support, slight motor sequelae were observed. CONCLUSION: Tetanus is still presented in the pediatric population, associated with lack of vaccination. It is necessary to know the disease to provide proper diagnosis and management according to international lineaments.",0,1228
1443,"CLINICAL CASE: A 29-year-old female with bilateral retinal capillary haemangiomas (RCH). A genetic analysis was carried out due to the suspicion of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, with negative results on 2occasions. There was progression of the RCH in the left eye, leading to a macular epiretinal membrane. The patient was treated with laser, intravitreal ranibizumab, and vitrectomy. Finally, a third genetic test detected a de novo mutation in the VHL gene, and led to the genetic diagnosis. DISCUSSION: VHL syndrome causes a complex ocular disease with a difficult diagnosis that requires early treatment of the RCH in order to modify its visual prognosis.",0,662
1444,"BACKGROUND: Pneumomediastinum is the presence of free air around mediastinal structures, which may be spontaneous or secondary, and can occur in 10% of patients with blunt chest trauma, with the Macklin effect being its main pathophysiology. CLINICAL CASE: A 21 year old male, hit by motor vehicle, with alveolopalatal fracture and blunt chest trauma, who, 72 hrs after admission, shows subcutaneous emphysema in the anterior chest. A simple tomography of the chest and abdomen was performed, finding a pneumomediastinum, bilateral pulmonary contusions and pneumoperitoneum. Oesophageal, tracheobronchial or intra-abdominal viscera injuries were ruled out, establishing the cause of pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum due to the Macklin effect. This required conservative management in intensive care unit, with a favourable clinical course and discharged after a 10 day hospital stay. DISCUSSION: Macklin effect is caused by dissection of air medially along the bronchoalveolar sheath (interstitial emphysema), secondary to alveolar breakdown and extending into mediastinal and other anatomical structures (pneumoperitoneum). It has been documented in blunt trauma, as well as in acute asthma, positive pressure ventilation, or after Valsalva manoeuvres. The imaging method of choice is computed tomography, and its characteristic findings, interstitial emphysema adhering to a bronchus and pulmonary blood vessel. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum is necessary to rule out oesophageal and tracheobronchial injury before establishing the Macklin effect as its cause. The diagnosis is made with computed tomography and managed conservatively.",0,1683
1445,"The spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus infection is rare, especially after liver transplantation, condition in which recurrence is almost universal. We report two cases in which clearance of the virus was achieved after liver transplantation. We reviewed the literature and described possible mechanisms explaining this phenomenon, with emphasis on therapeutic implications.",0,382
1446,Acquired thrombotic and thromboembolic disorders may be presented initially with symptoms and signs of acute ischaemia or organ dysfunction that will lead many of these patients to seek care in the emergency department. We report a case of a 19-year-old female patient who developed catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS syndrome or Asherson syndrome) 6 weeks post stillbirth with an initial presentation of acute vascular occlusion. The patient was immediately operated and anticoagulated with significant improvement.,0,526
1447,We report an asymptomatic 23-year-old woman with an isolated and persistent increase in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST). An extensive work up including laboratory and image testing revealed no abnormalities thus suggesting the presence of macro-AST. A polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation assay was performed and confirmed the presence of macro-AST.,0,369
1448,"The case is presented of a 14 year-old patient diagnosed with Sudeck's syndrome secondary to uneventful foot trauma. The patient complained of decreased visual acuity along with photophobia and intense ocular pain not correlated with the exploratory findings. Sudeck's syndrome is an idiopathic neuropathic inflammatory disease characterised by disproportionate pain, unrelated to a previous traumatic event, which can evolve to severe and generalised pain. A new explanation has recently described this as ""neuropathic eye pain"" for those patients with severe eye pain that do not correlate with clinical signs. In the case presented here, the pain became widespread and led to photophobia and very intense ocular neuropathic pain. It is believed that this was the cause of the visual decrease presented by this patient. It is proposed that the Sudeck syndrome should become part of the differential diagnosis of neuropathic eye pain.",0,935
1449,"The coronavirus strain HECV-4408 was isolated from diarrhea fluid of a 6-year-old child with acute diarrhea and propagated in human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cells. Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus particles in the diarrhea fluid sample and the infected HRT-18 cell cultures. This virus possessed hemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities and caused cytopathic effects in HRT-18 cells but not in MDBK, GBK and FE cells. One of four S-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted in Western blots with HECV-4408, BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138 but not with HCV-OC43, and two reacted with BCV-L9 but not with HECV-4408, BCV-LY138 and HCV-OC43. One S-specific and two N-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains. cDNA encompassing the 3' 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV-OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV-4408 and BCV. A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the non-structural genes of HCV-OC43 was not detected in HECV-4408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV-4408 and the virulent wild-type BCV. Forty-nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV-4408 and HCV-OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV-4408 and BCV-LY138. We thus conclude that the strain HECV-4408 is a hemagglutinating enteric coronavirus that is biologically, antigenically and genomically more closely related to the virulent BCV-LY138 than to HCV-OC43.",1,1762
1450,"Cytomegalovirus infection after a heart transplant is a recurrent medical condition. Its frequency increases when the donors are serum-positive, and the recipients are serum-negative to this virus. In the pediatric population, the infection only develops in a small percentage and the patients rarely present resistance to conventional treatment with ganciclovir and valganciclovir. We presented the first report of a pediatric case of the cytomegalovirus infection resistant to ganciclovir and valganciclovir after a heart transplant in a Peruvian public hospital with an unusual presentation. The resistance to these drugs was evident after 277 days of evolution of the disease considering the non-remission of the symptomatology and the persistence of an elevated viral load. The administration of foscarnet led to a clinical and laboratory improvement until remission of the disease.",0,887
1451,"Surgery for catecholamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumours poses a high anaesthetic risk that might increase due to coexisting congenital heart diseases, such as a single ventricle and Eisenmenger syndrome. This report emphasises the usefulness of pulse range haemodynamic monitoring over thermodilution in a patient with a single ventricle. In addition, the importance of nitric oxide is stressed in the management of respiratory problems associated to surgical-related pulmonary hypertension. As to the anaesthetic techniques, none is preferred as long as the one chosen has no haemodynamic repercussions.",0,607
1452,"Ketosis prone type 2 diabetes (KPD) is presently a well-defined clinical entity, characterized by a debut with severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis similar to the presenting form of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). However, it appears in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) phenotype. This situation is caused by an acute, reversible dysfunction of the beta cell in individuals with insulin resistance. Once the acute stage subsides, patients behave as having a DM2 and do not require insulin treatment. They should be kept on a diet and oral hypoglycemic drugs due to their susceptibility to have recurrent acute ketotic decompensations.",0,647
1453,"Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are congenital disorders secondary to an impaired immune response. Infections, autoimmune disorders, atopy, and lymphoproliferative syndromes are commonly associated with this disorder. OBJECTIVE: To present and discuss 3 infants diagnosed with PID. CLINICAL CASES: The cases are presented of three patients with PID diagnosed during their first admission to a Paediatric Intensive Critical Care Unit. The first patient, a 4-month-old infant affected by a severe pneumonia, and was diagnosed as a Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease. The second patient was an 8-month-old infant with Candida lusitaniae mesenteric adenitis, and diagnosed with a Chronic Granulomatous Disease. The last patient, a 6-month-old infant presented with ecthyma gangrenosum and X-linked agammaglobulinaemia. CONCLUSION: PID should be suspected when an infectious disease does not responde to the appropriate therapy within the expected period. An update of each disease is presented.",0,1004
1454,"Normoblasts may be seen in peripheral blood smear of newborns. The number of normoblasts per 100 white blood cells is generally in the range of 0-10.They can be seen more common than usual in hypoxic condition, because intrauterine hypoxia increases the production of red blood cells. However, multinucleated normoblasts in a newborn caused by hypoxia haven't been reported before. We present a newborn with multinucleated normoblasts secondary to intrauterine hypoxia. This case is important; because it is the first time multinucleated normoblasts in peripheral blood smear of a hypoxic newborn has been detected.",0,615
1455,"Granulomatous sarcoidosis-like reactions affecting multiple organ systems at one time have infrequently been described within weeks to months after initiation of Ipilimumab. We present the first case of a 67-year-old man with isolated cutaneous granulomatous reaction involving the trunk, extremities, and face after eighteen months of treatment with ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma. This case documents the eruption of isolated cutaneous granulomatous reaction as a late treatment-related adverse effect of ipilimumab, highlighting the importance of adequate, prolonged follow-up.",0,584
1456,"Hydatidosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, affects the spinal column in 0.5-2% of all cases, with the sacral column being a rare location typically observed only in adults. The case is reported of a 14-year-old boy from Juliaca (Puno, Peru) who presented with chronic lower back pain and cauda equina syndrome. He was initially attended to in Juliaca, and then transferred to the Hospital Edgardo Rebagliati Martins (Lima, Peru) with a diagnosis of sacral tumor. In magnetic resonance imaging, a multicystic tumor was seen with L5 and S1 lysis and instability. The surgical treatment was an L5- S2 laminectomy and extraction of multiple hydatid cysts followed by lumbopelvic stabilization with transpedicular screws. Post-operatively, he was prescribed albendazol (15 mg/kg/d) for six months. Hydatid cysts should be considered within the differential diagnosis when there are cystic lesions in the spinal column, particularly in endemic areas such as Peru.",0,962
1457,"OBJECTIVE: Paratesticular mesothelioma isan infrequent tumor and only 250 cases have been published.It originates in the scrotal tunica vaginalis. It represents0.3-1.4% of mesotheliomas and it predominates inpatients with history of asbestos exposure and old age. Itsdiagnosis is usually casual. Our objective is to present thecases that occurred in our service with malignant paratesticularmesothelioma and to carry out a review of the currentliterature on this pathology. METHODS: We report two cases diagnosed with malignantparatesticular mesothelioma that happened in the lasttwo years. RESULT: The first case was a 73-year-old male with asymptomatichydrocele. The second was a 57-year-oldmale who had testicular pain and hydrocele. Both werediagnosed of mesothelioma after hydrocelectomy. The firsttreatment was radical orchiectomy in both cases. The firstpatient did not need more treatments. The second patientpresented pulmonary nodules, lymphadenopathy and localrelapse, which was treated with chemotherapy and localresection. CONCLUSION: Paratesticular mesothelioma is an infrequenttumor. Scrotal mass associated with hydrocele is thetypical form of presentation. Surgical treatment consists ofradical orchiectomy. They have poor prognosis because inmost cases there is rapid local and dissemination.",0,1310
1458,"INTRODUCTION: Gangliogliomas are rare tumours that affect young patients, appear predominantly in the temporal lobe and usually begin with epileptic seizures. Histologically they have a grade I of malignancy, with an anaplastic form that is catalogued as grade III in the 2007 WHO classification. Yet, there are tumours that do not meet the criteria of either grade and which offer clear prognostic differences with respect to those of grade I. These tumours would be atypical gangliogliomas (grade II), which are not considered in this classification. From the molecular point of view, the best known alteration in gangliogliomas is the BRAF V600E mutation, which worsens the prognosis of the lesion. The possible use of treatments targeted towards this mutated protein is especially relevant in this disorder. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old male, who had undergone surgery due to a ganglioglioma on two occasions. The neuro-pathological examination revealed histological features consistent with an intermediate grade of malignancy (grade II), with positive BRAF mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The case presented here, together with those previously reported in the literature, reopens the debate on the definition of gangliogliomas in the 2007 WHO classification, and lends support to the fact that the next classification should again include atypical gangliogliomas (grade II), together with possible genetic mutations and molecular disorders.",0,1436
1459,"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a bacteria transmitted by infected ticks. It is characterized by fever, exanthema, arthralgias and myalgias; but sometimes its clinical presentation is non specific. Due to its similarities with other exanthematic diseases like dengue or chikungunya, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is not a first line diagnosis, even though countries like Mexico show the ecologic and socioeconomic characteristics that favor its transmission, with a 30% mortality rate among pediatric patients. This mortality rate has been associated to a delayed diagnosis and therapy, due to a poor knowledge among physicians regarding this disease; this favors the occurrence of atypical and fulminant cases. The objective of this work is to describe a fulminant case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, expecting that this disease could be later considered among the differential diagnosis which could directly impact its mortality rate.",0,980
1460,"Dematomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with a variable clinical spectrum. In recent years, a number of myositis-specific antibodies have been identified including anti-MDA5, which is us eful for diagnosis, prognosis and classification of the diverse clinical forms of the disease. This antibody is associated with cutaneous ulcers, rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease, early mortality and poor prognosis, so the detection of this antibody in a suitable clinical context, raises the need for an aggressive immunosuppressive treatment. We describe a case of dermatomyositis classified as hypomyopathic (i.e. involving mild muscle weakness), presenting specific skin lesions, interstitial lung disease, and presence of anti-MDA5 antibody that had a favorable response to combined treatment with cyclophosphamide, gamma globulin and corticosteroids.",0,870
1461,"CASE REPORT: A 17-year- old male with 2years history of an intraocular mass and progressive visual loss of the left eye. Spontaneous sclera rupture occurred during enucleation. Microscopic evaluation with H-E, PAS and immunohistochemistry (NSE, GAFP, SYN, CD99) revealed a small blue round cell malignant neoplasm with extensive necrosis and apoptosis. The optic nerve, ciliary body, choroid, anterior chamber, and sclera were infiltrated. SYN was positive and CD99 was negative in neoplastic cells, consistent with a poorly differentiated retinoblastoma. DISCUSSION: Retinoblastoma is the most frequent primary intraocular malignant tumour in childhood, but occasionally older patients can be affected. Immunohistochemistry is mandatory in poorly differentiated retinoblastomas.",0,779
1462,"The coexistence of different bone diseases in the same patient involves a complex differential diagnosis. A patient is presented who was studied due to a renal mass that showed many sclerotic lesions in spine and limbs in conventional radiology and CT. These lesions were evaluated with (99m)TC-HDP bone scintigraphy and (18)F-FDG PET/CT, which helped to obtain the definitive pathological diagnosis of osteopoikilosis (OP) co-existing with gastric cancer bone metastases. Of the different imaging scans performed, bone scintigraphy was particularly relevant due to its ability to discriminate between benign and metastatic bone disease.",0,637
1463,"Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders include a spectrum of inflammatory chronic diseases in which eosinophils infiltrate the gut in the absence of known causes of such tissue eosinophilia. They may affect any area of the gastrointestinal tract although exclusive colonic disease is exceptional. Due to their low prevalence these disorders are not usually taken into account when making a differential diagnosis in a patient with chronic diarrhea, which is the reason why in many cases the diagnosis can take many years. We describe the case of a patient with well-controlled celiac disease and chronic diarrhea of indeterminate origin. The final diagnosis was eosinophilic colitis. A complete response was obtained when she was treated with oral budesonide. Nowadays she remains asymptomatic.",0,803
1464,"Anomalous origin of one pulmonary artery from the aorta is rare. We report a case of a three-month-old infant with aortopulmonary window and anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta. He underwent surgery with anastomosis of the right pulmonary artery, ligation of the aortopulmonary window and the patent duct. He was released under medical treatment and had no signs of pulmonary hypertension or heart failure.",0,442
1465,"Little evidence exists to support the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, considering the complications associated with endotracheal intubation, we attempted to implement noninvasive mechanical ventilation in a 24-year-old patient who was 32 weeks pregnant and was admitted to the intensive care unit with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. Lack of tolerance to noninvasive mechanical ventilation led us to use an alternative method to avoid endotracheal intubation. The use of high-flow nasal cannula allowed to overcome this situation, wich supports this technique as a treatment option for critical obstetric patients that is safe for both the mother and fetus.",0,772
1466,"Infectious Spondylodiscitis is a rare infection in children. It is more frequent in patients under 6 years of age. We report the case of an 8-year-old patient with lumbar pain for 2 months, without fever. Xrays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging all three showed spondylodiscitis L4-L5. After a 10-day antibiotic treatment with clindamycin with regular response, a bone puncture was performed isolating Kingella kingae (Kk). Ostearticular infections caused by Kk have increased among infants and children. Due to improvement in culture techniques, the usage of automatic systems and assessment molecular techniques, these infections re-emerged in the past few years. Kk is a pathogen that has lately become significant in osteoarticular infections.",0,765
1467,"Significant sequence variation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) has never been detected since it was first reported in 2012. A MERS patient came from Korea to China in late May 2015. The patient was 44 years old and had symptoms including high fever, dry cough with a little phlegm, and shortness of breath, which are roughly consistent with those associated with MERS, and had had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases of MERS.After one month of therapy with antiviral, anti-infection, and immune-enhancing agents, the patient recovered in the hospital and was discharged. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for direct sequencing, which revealed two deletion variants of MERS CoV. Deletions of 414 and 419 nt occurred between ORF5 and the E protein, resulting in a partial protein fusion or truncation of ORF5 and the E protein. Functional analysis by bioinformatics and comparison to previous studies implied that the two variants might be defective in their ability to package MERS CoV. However, the mechanism of how these deletions occurred and what effects they have need to be further investigated.",1,1152
1468,"Pacemaker stimulation is associated with unpredictable severe cardiac events. We evaluated left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (LVMD) during prolonged septal right ventricular pacing. We performed 99mTc-MIBI gated-SPECT and phase analysis in 6 patients with pacemakers implanted at least one year before scintigraphy due to advanced atrioventricular block. Using V-Sync of Emory Cardiac Toolbox we obtained phase bandwidth (PBW) and standard deviation (PSD) from rest phase histogram. Clinical variables, QRS duration, rate and mode of pacing in septal right ventricle wall, chamber diameters, presence and extension of myocardial scar and ischemia and rest LVEF were recorded. Prolonged septal endocardial pacing is associated with marked LVMD, even when systolic function was preserved. More severe dyssynchrony was found in patients with impaired LVEF, higher left ventricle diameters, extensive infarct or severe ischemia than in patients with preserved LVEF (PBW: 177.3o vs. 88.3o; PSD: 53.1o vs. 33.8o). In the patients with ischemic heart disease and pacemaker, gated-SPECT phase analysis is a valid and potentially useful technique to evaluate LMVD associated with myocardial scar and to decide the upgrading to biventricular pacing mode.",0,1251
1469,"Nevus lipomatosus cutaneus superficialis is a rare, hamartomatous disorder, characterized by the presence of ectopic mature adipose tissue within the superficial dermis. Lesions occur within the first three decades of life. We report four new cases, including a patient with the most extensive affectation reported to date, which was associated with massive lipomas in the subcutaneous cell tissue and diffuse lipomatosis. To our knowledge, it is the first report of this disorder in Cuba.",0,489
1470,"OBJECTIVES: It is common to observe the persistence of extra-axial collections after craniotomies. Most of these disappear in weeks or months but some remain. The onset of focal symptoms or the growth of these persistent collections months or years after surgery may indicate the presence of a chronic and latent infection by germs of low virulence such as Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). METHODS: We present two clinical cases with persistent extra-axial collections, which required surgery years after diagnosis, in which P. acnes was isolated as an aetiological agent and we reviewed the literature published in this regard. RESULTS: These are two patients who, following surgical procedures (decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI and craniotomy for right parietal meningioma) and extra-axial collections were kept, which were monitored over time and then were infected and required emergency evacuation. In these collections P. acnes grew as a causal agent and required targeted antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: We must consider P. acnes as an infectious agent of post-surgical collections of long evolution. Atypical presentation and radiological changes may be helpful in diagnosis.",0,1188
1471,"Connective tissue diseases associated with silicone breast implants have been widely discussed. In the last decade, siliconosis has been included in the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) next to Gulf War syndrome, macrophage myofascitis and postvaccination phenomena. The ASIA syndrome may appear as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or more rarely, as adult Still's disease. We discuss the case of a patient with prolonged fever and clinical criteria for ASIA and Still's disease. The prostheses were resected and pathology showed absence of breast implant associated anaplastic lymphoma ALK (-). Physicians should be alert to these new entities linked to silicone breast implants.",0,704
1472,"On the fifth day after leaving the Parque Nacional El Rey, province of Salta, Argentina, where she made rural tourism, a woman of Italian origin, aged 47, developed an acute fever followed by a petechial and purpuric rash that progressed rapidly to multiorgan failure. She died on the sixth day after hospitalization. There were references to tick bites and a skin lesion similar to tache noire was found. The autopsy showed generalized vasculitis, ascites, pulmonary edema, acute tubular necrosis and portal centrilobular necrosis. Spleen and liver tissue were processed for PCR Rickettsia spp, based on the detection of the gltA gene. The result was positive. The amplicons obtained were sequenced and the results were compared with the preset sequences on the BLAST program, 99% coinciding with R. rickettsii. The low sensitivity of the health system to recognize this disease and the insufficient information generated from tourism-related media are factors that affect the delay to implement effective treatment and appropriate prevention standards.",0,1054
1474,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly of the intestinal rotation and fixation, and usually occurs in the neonatal age. OBJECTIVE: Description of a clinical case associated with acute occlusive symptoms. CLINICAL CASE: A case of intestinal malrotation is presented in a previously asymptomatic woman of 46 years old with an intestinal obstruction, with radiology and surgical findings showing an absence of intestinal rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal malrotation in adults is often asymptomatic, and is diagnosed as a casual finding during a radiological examination performed for other reasons. Infrequently, it can be diagnosed in adults, associated with an acute abdomen.",0,695
1475,"Paraquat, a non-selective bipyridyl pesticide, is one of the leading causes of death from intoxication in many parts of Asia and America. It is the second most sold herbicide worldwide, being widely used in Chile. Its ingestion generates toxicity due to the release of superoxide radicals, mainly affecting kidneys, lungs and liver. There is no antidote available. We report a 31 years old male who ingested Paraquat for suicidal purposes. He developed an acute renal and hepatic failure and a rapidly progressive severe respiratory failure with images compatible with acute pulmonary fibrosis. No response to immunosuppressive treatment was observed. He died eight days after admission. The use of cyclophosphamide associated with glucocorticoids could lower risk of death the in these patients, although the pathophysiology of respiratory failure is still under study.",0,870
1476,"BACKGROUND: Fratricide is the killing of one's own bother. It's a type of homicide rarely seen on psychiatric practice. This is still a theme which is poorly studied, and not well understood by the scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a men, with paranoid schizophrenia that murdered his own bother and had a psychiatric forensic evaluation to establish his penal responsibility. METHODS: A psychiatric interview was carried out and the psychiatric diagnosis was established based on the interview and analysis of forensic and medical records, using the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Literature review was held about the theme. RESULTS: The examinee was considered not guilty by reason of insanity, due to the presence of a mental disorder that affected her entire understanding and volition of the practiced act. CONCLUSIONS: The study of such cases may illustrate and identify motivating factors related to homicidal behavior in individuals with severe mental disorders.",0,979
1477,"BACKGROUND: Waugh's syndrome is the combination of intussusception and intestinal malrotation. The first case was described in 1911, with few cases being reported since then. CLINICAL CASE: A 7 month-old infant with fever, vomiting and rectal bleeding. Distension and an abdominal mass was found on examination. An exploratory laparotomy was preformed that found a combination of intussusception and intestinal malrotation, which was treated succesfully. CONCLUSION: We consider that this combination is not sufficiently diagnosed very often, leading to its disappearance.",0,572
1478,"CASE REPORT: The case is described of a patient who had a sudden loss of vision in her right eye after glaucoma surgery. A diagnosis of retinal toxicity due to tobramycin (an aminoglycoside) was reached, which was characterised by retinal whitening with a red cherry stain, macular oedema, and vasculitis that progressed to papillary and macular atrophy with arteriolar sclerosis. Given the severity of symptoms an early attempt was made with megadoses of steroids and an intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex(R), Allergan S.A.), without response. DISCUSSION: Aminoglycoside toxicity is a rare, idiosyncratic, very serious complication for which there is no effective treatment.",0,684
1479,"This text aims to analyze socio-cultural aspects in relation to the trajectory of habitual consumption of psychoactive substances of a young inmate. The young woman was in a detention center for minors in Medellin, Colombia, where interviews were conducted and participant observation was carried out. From there, the importance of aspects related to gender as a protective and risk elements was evident. Finally, this study presents some elements related to the detoxification process while she was following her sanction in internment.",0,537
1480,"We report the case of a 3-month-old boy hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Respiratory distress was associated with cardiogenic shock caused by chaotic atrial tachycardia. The cause of bronchiolitis was a coronavirus NL63 viral infection, confirmed in nasopharyngeal aspirations. The patient required intensive care including diuretics (furosemide), anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone and digoxin), and inotropic drugs (milrinone and levosimendan) associated with mechanical ventilation. The outcome was favorable in 10 days and the sinusal cardiac rhythm was completely restored at discharge.",1,596
1481,"CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of 48 year-old male complaining of a painful left upper eyelid and swelling of the lacrimal gland, with a suspicion of dacryoadenitis. Removal was decided after dacriops suspicion. Histopathology diagnosed a pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland, with areas of necrosis. DISCUSSION: Lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenoma usually presents as a slowly progressive painless mass. However, painful presentation in this case might be related with necrotic foci found in the histopathological examination. Although not described in lacrimal glands, pleomorphic adenomas have already been reported in the major and minor salivary glands, and these patients also presented with a painful mass.",0,723
1482,"Stiff Man syndrome or stiff-person syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder. It is characterized by increased axial muscular tone and limb musculature, and painful spasms triggered by stimulus. The case is presented of a 44-year-old man with stiff-person syndrome undergoing an injection of botulinum toxin in the urethral sphincter under sedation. Before induction, all the surgical team were ready in order to minimise the anaesthetic time. The patient was monitored by continuous ECG, SpO2 and non-invasive blood pressure. He was induced with fractional dose of propofol 150 mg, fentanyl 50 mug and midazolam 1mg. Despite careful titration, the patient had an O2 saturation level of 90%,which was resolved by manual ventilation. There was no muscle rigidity or spasm during the operation. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged 2 days later. A review of other cases is presented. The anaesthetic concern in patients with stiff-person syndrome is the interaction between the anaesthetic agents, the preoperative medication, and the GABA system. For a safe anaesthetic management, total intravenous anaesthesia is recommended instead of inhalation anaesthetics, as well as the close monitoring of the respiratory function and the application of the electrical nerve stimulator when neuromuscular blockers are used.",0,1344
1483,"BACKGROUND: DRESS Syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) is an uncommon disease caused by drugs. It is characterized by a polymorphic disseminated eruption with fever and multiple organ dysfunction. AIM: To report the etiology, characteristics, treatment, prognosis, and follow up of patients with DRESS Syndrome admitted to a clinical hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of patients admitted for drug reactions, selecting those patients complying with clinical criteria for DRESS Syndrome. Drugs used during three months prior to the onset of symptoms were evaluated as possible causes of the disease. RESULTS: Nine patients aged 16 to 68 years (six males) complied with the clinical criteria for the disease. The causative medications were carbamazepine in three patients, phenytoin in three, antituberculous drugs in two and amoxicillin in one. All were treated with systemic steroids with a complete clinical resolution. CONCLUSIONS: DRESS syndrome is usually underdiagnosed and has a good response to systemic steroids.",0,1072
1484,"The gram-negative bacillus Yokenella regensburgei (of the Enterobacteriaceae family) can be found in groundwater and foodstuffs, as well as the digestive tracts of insects and reptiles. Although it has been isolated from humans since its original description, it has rarely been reported as a cause of infection, and then, only in immunosuppressed patients. We report the first case of post-surgical secondary osteomyelitis due to Y. regensburgei in an immunocompetent woman who had undergone a craniotomy.",0,506
1485,"Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) refers to a heterogeneous group of monogenic diabetes. Unlike other types of MODY characterized by genetic defects in transcription factors, MODY 2 is triggered by metabolic alterations caused by mutations of glucokinase (GCK), the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. We report a three-generation Chilean family with multiple cases affected with this disease. The index case is a patient who presented severe neonatal hyperglycemia (831 mg/dl, without ketosis) requiring continuous infusion of insulin, which was suspended after 48 hours with normalization of blood glucose. Subsequently, continuous glucose monitoring at 4 months of age revealed 47% of tissue glucose levels above 140 mg/dl, with fasting glucose levels between 120 and 166 mg/dl. The genetic analysis revealed a previously reported mutation in heterozygous state of the GCK gene (c.148C>T; p.His50Tyr). This mutation was also identified in more than one affected relative in the last two generations, with a transmission pattern suggestive of dominant inheritance. GCK gene sequencing led to a correct molecular diagnosis of MODY 2 while bioinformatic analysis indicated the possible molecular causes of the enzyme dysfunction. The knowledge of the molecular diagnosis allowed an adequate medical treatment for this disease.",0,1340
1486,"Endomyocardial fibrosis is a restrictive cardiomyopathy with high morbidity and mortality rates, prevalent in the sub-Saharan Africa region but infrequent in our population. It has a close relation with blood hypereosinophilia. Hypoxic hepatitis is frequently observed in intensive care units and its diagnosis is clinical. It shows a typical enzyme pattern with high mortality too. There are multiple mechanisms responsible for this condition, such as ischemia, passive congestion and dysoxia. We described the case of a 35 year-old cocaine addict woman diagnosed with endomyocardial fibrosis and hypereosinophilic syndrome who developed cardiogenic shock with hypoxic hepatitis. The patient evolved favorably with the appropriate treatment.",0,742
1487,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease are frequently associated. The percutaneous approach may sometimes involve additional difficulties to the coronary artery disease. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented on an 82 year-old male patient with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, a Leriche syndrome and axillobifemoral bypass, who was admitted to hospital due to an inferior myocardial infarction. The procedure approach (radial, brachial, or femoral access routes for percutaneous coronary treatment) and associated complications from the procedure are discussed. CONCLUSION: Although technical improvements and/or treatment of peripheral vascular lesions may allow percutaneous coronary intervention, individual risk and benefit in each patient must be assessed.",0,794
1488,"OBJECTIVE: To know the dermatologic side effects of intravesical treatment with Mitomycin C in non muscle invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: We describe two cases of palm and plantar dermatitis after such treatment. RESULT: We describe two types of dermatitis pathogenesis during treatment with intravesical Mitomycin C: contact dermatitis and delayed hypersensitivity dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Contact dermatitis of non-allergic origin is a common side effect described in many instances in the literature, on the other hand exists dermatitis secondary to delayed hypersensitivity type IV much less common, requiring treatment with corticosteroids.",0,647
1489,"Hemihypertrophy syndrome and cor triatriatum are extremely rare pathologies. Hemihypertrophy is defined as complete or partial overgrowth of one of the hemibodies. Cor triatriatum is a congenital heart disease characterized by a membrane which separates the left atrium into two chambers; if that membrane has a restrictive hole, it causes obstruction to blood passage from the pulmonary veins into the left ventricle causing hypertension and pulmonary edema. In this context, the patent ductus arteriosus can act as a means of decompression of the pulmonary circuit, because it allows the blood passage from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. We report a patient with Silver-Rusell syndrome (hemihypertrophy), cor triatriatum and ductus arteriosus with reverse flow. To our knowledge, this association of rare pathologies and this clinical presentation have not been described previously.",0,889
1490,"CASE REPORT: A middle-aged adult male was referred to our institution due to unilateral corneal edema for a possible corneal transplant. At first, the patient denied a history of trauma. A small foreign body, which had been overlooked by the primary ophthalmologist, was detected by gonioscopy, embedded in the anterior chamber angle. It was successfully surgically removed and visual results were good. DISCUSSION: In any patient with unilateral unexplained corneal edema, it is necessary to rule out the presence of a foreign body in the anterior chamber.",0,557
1491,"The one and a half Fisher syndrome is produced by an unilateral lesion in the dorsal and inferior part of the pons located specifically in the pontine tegmentum. This is an area that contains the medial longitudinal fasciculus (LMF), the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and the nucleus of the sixth cranial nerve, responsible for the horizontal movements of the gaze. Clinically it manifests with conjugate gaze palsy with internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The case is reported on a 60 year-old patient, who presented with binocular diplopia, ophthalmoplegia and paralysis of the gaze conjugated to the left. Imaging studies were performed that showed a hemi-protuberant haematoma secondary to a cavernoma. As expected, he presented with several episodes of re-bleeding with clinical worsening: headache, diplopia, tetraparesis, and hypoaesthesia in the right side of the face, as such that the microsurgical exeresis of the protuberant cavernoma was considered.",0,972
1492,"Brain metastases are the most commonly seen intracranial lesions in adults. What is more, meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumours after gliomas and their imaging characteristics are well known in both CT and MRI scans. However, there are lesions that can mimic meningiomas in imaging studies, including metastases of extracranial tumours, confronting us with a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We present the case of a patient with meningeal metastasis of a uterine leiomyosarcoma that was not known at the time of the surgical intervention.",0,567

1494,"INTRODUCTION: Hypotonic-Hyporesponsive Episode (HHE) is an adverse event after vaccination, mainly associated with whole-cell pertussis vaccines. It is characterized by a sudden onset of muscle flaccidity, reduced response to stimuli and pallor or cyanosis. Although the HHE is infrequent, it is considered a severe adverse event. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of HHE following the administration of the whole-cell pertussis combination vaccine (DTwP-HB-Hib), which is included in National Im munization Program (PNI) of Chile, and to contributing to the knowledge of this adverse event in the country. CASE REPORT: A 6-month-old infant, 3 hours post-vaccination with the third dose of DTwP-HB-Hib vaccine, presented a decreased level of consciousness that was interpreted as atonic seizure but finally considered as EHH. The infant progressed favorably after 2 hours of clinical observation and was discharged 24 hours later. Parents were suggested to continue the immunization schedule of the infant with acellular pertussis vaccines as a preventive measure. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of knowledge about the EHH may discourage childhood immunization. Therefore, it is important for the medical staff to inform parents of the patients about this benign, self-limited and non-recurrent adverse event. In these cases, it is recommended to continue the immunization schedule of the infant with acellular pertussis vaccines.",0,1415
1495,"Here we describe the case of a 19-year-old woman, in her 29th week of gestation, who was from Llumpe (Ancash, Peru) and had a history of traveling to Chanchamayo (Junin, Peru) and Rinconada (Ancash, Peru). The patient presented at Chacas Hospital (Chacas, Ancash, Peru) with general malaise, dehydration, respiratory distress, jaundice, the sensation of thermal rise, and abdominal pain. Analysis of blood smears revealed 60% hemoparasites. She was transferred to Ramos Guardia Hospital (Huaraz, Peru) where she presented increasing respiratory distress, choluria, hematuria, and decreased urine output, moreover she was positive for Plasmodium. From there she was transferred to Cayetano Heredia Hospital (Lima, Peru), where she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple organ failure, stillbirth, and leading to death. She underwent mechanical ventilation, was administered clindamycin, and was prescribed quinine, which she did not received due a lack by availability. The evolution of the illness was torpid, and she ultimately developed multiple organ failure and died. Plasmodium vivax infection was confirmed. Accordingly, we emphasize the importance of improving our diagnostic capabilities and management techniques to enable clinicians to provide adequate and timely treatment.",0,1305
1496,"We describe the case of a 17-year-old male patient living in Salta city who, 10 days after visiting a rural area in Salta province, was hospitalized for febrile seizures. Shortly after admission, he developed an exanthema followed by a multiple organ dysfunction that evolved to irreversible septic shock followed by death 48 hours after admission. Serological diagnosis -high IgM and IgG anti-Rickettsia spp. antibody titres as detected by indirect immunofluorescence- arrived post mortem. Spotted fever group rickettsioses are tick-borne diseases distributed worldwide and continue being under diagnosed in several countries mainly due to a low clinical suspicion. In the north-western provinces of Argentina there is also the limitation of not counting with a regional laboratory to perform the etiological diagnosis. This is crucial because the severe forms of the disease, which are commonly caused by R. rickettsii, have been already documented in the region. Given that spotted fevers have broadly unspecific febrile presentations and the components of the enzootic cycle are present even in geographic areas not yet considered to be endemic for tick borne diseases, their diagnosis should not be underestimated. If the adequate antibiotic treatment is administered timely, the prognosis of this group of life-threatening diseases improves drastically.",0,1359
1497,"CLINICAL CASE: A 4-year-old patient, who presented with an immediate orbital haematoma as a result of a subtenon injection of triamcinolone in the trochlear region of the right eye on finishing a surgical procedure for Brown's syndrome. After one week, when it could be examined better, the presence of a cherry red spot was observed due to the embolisation of the central artery of the retina by triamcinolone crystals. DISCUSSION: Triamcinolone is an anti-inflammatory drug currently used in Ophthalmology for the treatment of various conditions. Although exceptional, it has been described that its use may provoke embolisations due to the entry of the steroid into the circulation.",0,685
1498,"A case is presented of a 5 year-old patient with bilateral hereditary retinoblastoma treated with radiotherapy in the right eye and enucleation of the left eye. After three years without evidence of progression, the patient presented with a right orbital mass that compromised the frontal bone. After surgical excision, the histology analysis was consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell tumour. Primary orbital bone neoplasms, such as giant cell tumours, are extremely rare. Both radiological and histopathology studies are essential to establish the differential diagnosis of orbital mass lesions.",0,600
1499,"Mycoplasma hominis is a fastidious bacterium, which usually colonizes the lower urogenital tract and may cause systemic infections in neonates and genital infections in adults. It can also be the cause of serious extra-genital infections, mainly in immunosuppressed or predisposed subjects. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of bacteremia caused by M. hominis in a previously healthy woman after uterine curettage due to incomplete abortion. M. hominis could be an underestimated cause of bacteremia in immunocompetent patients. Mycoplasma organisms have fastidious growth requirements, are often difficult to culture on a cell-free medium and have no cell wall. The conventional method for detection may fail. This is the first report of M. hominis isolation from a positive automated blood culture (BD BACTEC, USA).",0,821
1500,"Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-producing tumour and laparoscopic adrenalectomy is its treatment of choice. During pneumoperitoneum insufflation and tumour handling there is a high risk of massive catecholamine release and hypertensive crisis. After tumour excision, severe arterial hypotension is a common effect, due to relative vasodilation and the residual effect of antihypertensive drugs. We report the case of a patient with pheochromocytoma who was treated with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. During surgical manipulation there was a sudden hypertensive peak that could be controlled quickly with clevidipine infusion. After tumour resection, clevidipine perfusion was stopped and there were no arterial hypotension episodes. Clevidipine is a new intravenous calcium antagonist with rapid onset of action and short half-life that has no residual effect and does not produce arterial hypotension after tumour resection. For these reasons, it can be a first-choice drug for this kind of surgery.",0,1002
1501,"BACKGROUND AND OBJETIVE: To describe a new molecular variant of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in a 27 year-old patient with splenomegaly and abolition of osteotendinous reflexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: NPC1 is the main gene with described mutation in NPC disease. Here we report a case with a new mutation, p.N916S, not described before in a patient diagnosed with NPC. RESULTS: p.N916S was described as a cause of NPC disease by predictive programmes Mutation Master, PolyPhen2 and SIFT. CONCLUSIONS: p.N916S is a new mutation detected as a cause of NPC disease in a patient without severe neurological symptoms.",0,616
1502,Multiple-drug-resistant enterococcal infections canbe a serious problem in pediatric patients particularly concomitance with severe underlying diseases and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The treatment options in children are limited compared with adults. We report a 3-year old-boy with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M7 and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteremia successfully treated with daptomycin. Daptomycin may be an alternative therapy for VRE infections in children; more studies are needed for extended usage.,0,536
1503,"INTRODUCTION: Leucinosis is a severe neonatal metabolic disease. It is the consequence of the genetically determined enzyme deficiency of the complex formed by decarboxylase-dihydrolipoyl transacylase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, and of the subsequent accumulation of precursor metabolites, long branched-chain amino acids and their alpha ketoacids. They are powerful neurotoxins, responsible for the swift onset of oedema and diffuse cerebral demyelination. Delays in its diagnosis usually result in severe psychomotor sequelae or even death. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a newborn female patient with severe neonatal encephalopathy, epileptic seizures and an electroencephalogram (EEG) with certain special characteristics that guided the diagnosis towards that of possible leucinosis. Early diagnosis makes it possible to establish specific treatment and achieve a favourable patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: An EEG in patients with suspected neonatal encephalopathy offers highly cost-effective functional information at a low cost, especially because it promotes early diagnoses and treatments. In cases of leucinosis, EEG presents peculiar signs that are easily recognisable in early periods in most patients, as occurred in the case reported here. We believe EEG should be included in screening for neonatal encephalopathies because it is a valuable, innocuous and generally accessible diagnostic technique. It is especially helpful in treatable metabolic diseases, such as leucinosis.",0,1499
1504,"BACKGROUND: Mesenteric cysts are very rare abdominal growths, generally asymptomatic, and which are usually detected incidentally while performing a physical examination or an imaging test. Complications such as infections, haemorrhage, torsion, rupture, or bowel obstruction, are seldom found in this pathology, but they can be a cause of acute abdomen. The purpose of this report is to describe the characteristics and the clinical outcome of a male patient with an infected mesenteric pseudocyst of the jejunum. CLINICAL CASE: A 49 year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with 6-day onset of abdominal pain, bowel obstruction signs, palpable tumour located in the upper hemi-abdomen, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 36,100/mm(3) white cells, 4.21 ng/ml procalcitonin, abdominal computed tomography scan with evidence of a mesenteric cystic tumour. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding the presence of a mesenteric pseudocyst of the jejunum with infection signs, extirpated and sent for histopathological examination. The clinical progress of the patient was satisfactory with the discharge of the patient 7 days after the surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: These cysts can debut as an acute abdomen due to haemorrhage, infection, obstruction and/or bowel perforation, complications can be life threatening if not detected and surgically treated at an early stage by performing a resection of the pseudocysts, with or without bowel resection, depending on the location and the size of the cyst.",0,1532
1506,"Cervical Traumatic SSH are very rare in literature. They are usually caused by cardiopulmonary diseases that increase vascular pressure causing spinal vessels rupture. In thoracolumbar spine, the spinal puncture is the most common cause. The ventrolateral position is even more unusual. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), an abrupt extension-flexion movement could have caused the rupture of subarachnoid vessels. This, accompanied by the slowed blood ""wash out"" (probably due to the previous osteoarthrosis and spinal canal stenosis), led to the formation of an organized clot, which caused an acute spinal cord compression syndrome. Cervical subarachnoid spinal hematoma can present as Brown-Sequard syndrome. The treatment is prompt surgical removal and decompression. The posterior approach (partial hemilaminectomy with or without laminoplasty) with microsurgical technique is feasible, fast and simple to evacuate the hematoma with good results. Surgical nuances in posterior approach are: small spinal canal, difficulty in mobilizing the cervical cord, these haematomas are wrapped and attached to the spinal cord or nerve roots by multiple arachnoid bands, requiring techniques of Microdissection for its evacuation unlike the epidural and subdural haematomas that are easily aspirated. Here, we report a unique case of a ventrolateral SSH due to TBI.",0,1357
1507,"BACKGROUND: Bleeding from the small bowel is a rare pathology that represents 5-10% of gastrointestinal bleeding; 0.06% to 5% of cases are due to the presence of diverticula of the small intestine. The majority of diverticula are asymptomatic and present symptoms when there is a complication. CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure and hypertension. While he was hospitalized due to cerebrovascular disease he recurrently presented lower gastrointestinal bleeding that required blood transfusion on several occasions. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding and colon bleeding were ruled out by endoscopy. It was not until an arteriography was performed that we identified bleeding at proximal jejunum level, and therefore we performed a laparotomy. We present the studies and management that the patient underwent. CONCLUSION: Although jejunal diverticula are rare, they must be included in the differential diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleeding when present in a patient. Arteriography is a study of great use in locating the site, provided the bleeding is more than 0.5ml/minute.",0,1140
1508,"INTRODUCTION: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is caused by a pathologic and destructive response of the organism as a result of the interaction between donor immunocompetent T lymphocytes and the recipient tisular antigens. It's considered the most serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, most frequently described after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The skin is usually the first and most commonly affected organ, in both acute and chronic, with a variable clinical spectrum of presentation. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of vitiligo as a manifestation of cutaneous chronic GVHD, a low prevalence sign, which recognition could help to suspect this severe compli cation. CASE REPORT: 8 years old male, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 3 years old, had a combined medullary and central nervous system (NCS) relapse with minimal positive disease 3 years afterwards. After 4 years ALL was diagnosed, he received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Seven months after the BMT he presented multiple melanocytic nevi with peripheral hypopigmentation, and some isolated asymptomatic, confluent achromic macules on the face, trunk and limbs. The skin biopsy was compatible with chronic vitiligo and sclerodermiform type GVHD. He received topical treatment with Tacrolimus, achieving clinical stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: GVHD leads to the appearance of autoantibodies that could act as a trigger in the onset of autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo. Consequently it could explain this poorly described manifestation in the literature of chronic cutaneous GVHD.",0,1603
1509,"The case is presented on a patient with abdominal pain and suspicion of neuroendocrine tumor in the tail of the pancreas shown in the abdominal CT and MRI. Whole-body scintigraphy and abdominal SPECT/CT with (99m)Tc-octreotide were performed that showed a nodular lesion partially on the posterior side of the pancreas tail. This nodule showed faint tracer uptake, and was reported as probable neuroendocrine tumor. Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed, and the histological study identified the lesion as an ectopic spleen. There are similar cases in the literature that match these findings, but this lesion is still frequently diagnosed after performing unnecessary surgery. When an asymptomatic intrapancreatic mass is detected, an accessory spleen should be considered and specific diagnostic techniques should be performed, such as labeled and denatured red blood cell SPECT/CT.",0,901
1510,"The bone cyst is a rare benign tumor that usually develops in childhood. There are several treatment options, however when it is located within the pelvis treatment is complex. A 7 year-old patient who presented with 3 months of right hip pain and limping. The initial radiograph showed a discrete periostic reaction and acetabulum effacement. The MRI and CT scans suggested the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst and was confirmed by open biopsy. Two serial embolizations were performed with good results, the patient was asymptomatic one year after.",0,550
1511,"BACKGROUND: Among the rarest types of cancer found are the small intestine malignancies, representing only 2% of all gastrointestinal cancer and 0.1-0.3% of all malignancies. The most common subtype of this tumour is the adenocarcinoma, which is located mainly in the duodenum, jejunum and, rarely, in ileum. CLINICAL CASE: A 75 year-old male, with no any surgical history, who in the previous three months, referred to two clinical episodes of partial bowel obstruction and unquantified weight loss. When admitted into the surgical service, the patient referred to a partial bowel obstruction of more than one week onset. A laparotomy was performed, finding 3 stenosis rings at the ileum end portion, carrying out an intestinal resection and enteral-enteral anastomosis. On the seventh day there was dehiscence of the anastomosis and abdominal sepsis. New surgery was performed with the resection of the intestinal anastomosis and an ileostomy. The pathologist report indicated a small bowel adenocarcinoma moderately differentiated, ulcerated, and multifocal. It was classified as stage III or T3N1M0. The patient progress was satisfactorily, managed as outpatient with postoperative chemotherapy with 5 fluorouracil and cisplatin. The patient died a year later due to liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the extreme rarity of the case, is very likely that general surgeons may find one or two cases of adenocarcinoma of the ileum in their professional career. Thus, they must suspect this pathology when faced with an episode of intestinal obstruction in the adult.",0,1570
1512,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomembranous colitis, caused by Clostridium difficile, has seen an increased incidence in recent years, driven mainly by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Although initial treatment is medical, the role of emergency surgery has gained ground due to high mortality and the emergence of increasingly virulent strains. In our country the prevalence is still low so that sometimes our experience in handling is limited. AIM: To analyze our surgical experience in treatment of this disease and to remember the role of surgery as well as some technical aspects of it. CLINICAL CASES: We present 2 cases of patients who have suffered a fulminant pseudomembranous colitis unresponsive to initial medical treatment and requiring urgent surgical intervention with a good response to it. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to keep in mind the surgical option in treatment of pseudomembranous colitis, especially when it presents as fulminant colitis, there are associated complications or failure to respond to medical treatment.",0,1033
1513,"Caudal regression syndrome is an uncommon congenital malformation that includes a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Characterised by caudal musculoskeletal compromise, it can be associated to neurological, gastrointestinal, renal and genitourinary defects. Although the specific aetiology has not been clarified, it has been associated with the presence of maternal diabetes and mutations in homeobox gene HBLX9. Its diagnosis is based on a good prenatal ultrasound detection, detailed physical examination, and post-natal imaging study using radiography and magnetic resonance. Caudal regression syndrome requires multidisciplinary management, and it seems that good metabolic control of gestational diabetes constitutes the best preventive measure available. We present the clinical case and images of a male term newborn, born to a pregestational diabetic mother with poor metabolic control and a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of lumbar spine, iliac bones and lower limbs malformation. Born in good conditions, the diagnosis was confirmed using X-rays and magnetic resonance.",0,1085
1514,"Monoarthritis is a diagnostic challenge for the clinician, as the list of associated conditions is quite long. It is accepted that in patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease monoarthritis represents exacerbation of the underlying disease. However, ignoring the systematized approach to monoarthritides may lead to omissions and mistaken diagnostic implications. This report describes the approach to a case of pseudoseptic arthritis that mimicked an acute episode of recurrent arthritis due to monosodium urate in a patient with retention of an intraarticular foreign body.",0,589
1515,"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a multifocal tumor that rarely metastasizes. It is difficult to diagnose, most often it is an incidental finding in young asymptomatic women. The radiologic pattern is heterogeneous. Histologic confirmation of Weibel-Palade bodies or immunohistochemistry based on specific tumor markers such as factor VIII and CD34 are the most important finding to confirm the diagnosis. We report a 21 years old woman Presenting with cough and dyspnea. A chest X ray was suggestive of tuberculosis. Sputum smears were negative for acid fat bacilli and the tuberculin test was negative. A chest CAT scan showed multiple nodular lesions. A surgical biopsy of the lesions confirmed the presence of a hemangioendothelioma. The patient was initially treated with prednisone and azathioprine without response. Thereafter, the patient is without treatment and without evidence of disease progression.",0,915
1516,"Sciatic nerve injuries associated with acetabular fractures can be post-traumatic, perioperative or postoperative. Late postoperative injury is very uncommon and can be due to heterotopic ossifications, muscular scarring, or implant migration. A case is presented of a patient with a previous transverse acetabular fracture treated with a reconstruction plate for the posterior column. After 17 years, she presented with progressive pain and motor deficit in the sciatic territory. Radiological and neurophysiological assessments were performed and the patient underwent surgical decompression of the sciatic nerve. A transection of the nerve was observed that was due to extended compression of one of the screws. At 4 years postoperatively, her pain had substantially diminished and the paresthesias in her leg had resolved. However, her motor symptoms did not improve. This case report could be relevant due to this uncommon delayed sciatic nerve injury due to prolonged hardware impingement.",0,995
1517,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric, inflammatory angioproliferative cancer associated with herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). It has four clinico-epidemiological types: classic, endemic, iatrogenic and epidemic, or HIV associated. Clinically it may be indolent or aggressive, mainly affecting mucocutaneous areas with eventual visceral and lymph node involvement. It is often present and in a more aggressive form in the HIV-positive population. We report a case of a 27-year-old HIV- negative male patient with a bleeding tumoral lesion in the Waldeyer ring, multiple lymphadenopathies and exophytic foot lesions that remit with anthracycline-based emergency chemotherapy. HIV-negative KS is a rare condition. It is important to consider Peru as an endemic region for HHV-8. The oral involvement of KS is a rare manifestation and of poor prognosis, however, the HIV-negative factor could confer a good prognosis.",0,907
1518,"INTRODUCTION: Thalamic vascular lesions as strategic strokes can cause amnesia, executive dysfunctions or dysphasia and behavioral or psychological symptoms causing vascular dementia. CASE REPORT: A 58 years-old woman with hypertension and dyslipemia, who after a left thalamic hemorrhage with good radiological evolution, presents a severe amnesic syndrome as well as other subtle changes in orientation and in language, difficulties in managing money and depressive symptoms requiring anxiolytic and antidepressive treatment. All this joined to limitations in the normal course of her work. Followed by neurology service, a positron emission tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography was performed, which showed a hypometabolism in left thalamic area and also in ipsilateral inferior frontal region, explained by the diaschisis phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Diaschisis phenomenon is a neuroimaging and pathophysiological finding whereby thalamic or basal ganglia strokes cause hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in the ipsilateral or contralateral cortex and could explain cortical distal symptoms. This case report demonstrates the presence of thalamocortical connections, which helps to understand the circuitry of memory and help to explain the association of other cortical symptoms as dysphasia or executive dysfunction.",0,1357
1519,"Sex cord tumor with annular tubules is an extremely uncommon gonadal stromal neoplasm. It represents 0.05-0.6% of all ovarian tumors, according to series. An unusual case is presented in a 6-year-old girl, detected as a result of an isosexual peripheral precocious puberty. The highlight of this case is that no mass attached to the ovary was found, but only a gonadal asymmetry without radiological signs of malignancy. After confirming the presence of tumoral cells by intraoperative biopsy, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with ipsilateral para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Afterwards, the evolution of the patient was favorable.",0,653
1520,"Actinomycosis is a chronic, suppurative, inflammatory granulomatous disease caused by gram positive anaerobic filamentous bacteria of the genus Actinomyces, most frequently Actinomyces israelii. We report a case of a 42-year-old male presenting with abdominal pain, a 10kg weight loss and a fixed mass in the epigastrium. Tomography revealed dilatation of the intestinal loops and thickening of the colon walls; the coexistence of these two findings suggested a lymphoproliferative process. The tumour, ileum fragment and colon were surgically removed; these were adherent to the serosal fibro-adipose tissue. Microscopically, abundant polymorphonuclear infiltrate and grains of bacteria compatible with Actinomyces spp.were seen.",0,730
1521,"Percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel tumour ablation method. The application of short and high-voltage electrical pulses to the target lesion induces alterations in cell membrane permeability, finally causing tumour cell death. The extremely high-voltage that is needed in this technique requires the surveillance and management of an experienced anaesthesiologist, as it involves a significant risk of complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or seizures. The case is presented of a 66 year-old patient diagnosed with a renal adenocarcinoma, and who received without intention-to-cure IRE under general anaesthesia. This case represents the first time this type of technique is used in Spain.",0,717
1522,"The article presents a rare case of uterine rupture at the 19th week of gestation, in the presence of a scar after a caesarean section practiced two years earlier. The fetus was pulled out alive, but given the gestational age, died within a few minutes. The uterus was preserved, but the woman was advised to proceed with tubal ligation and, in any case, to absolutely avoid a new pregnancy. The literature on uterine rupture is examined focusing on the problem of uterine rupture resulting after a caesarean section, analyzing the possibility of monitoring the risk of rupture through ultrasound evaluation. Finally, the article conducts a moral analysis of the case in the light of catholic moral, questioning in particular the acceptability of a hysterectomy under certain conditions. The illegitimacy of direct sterilization is reaffirmed, that is to say, an intervention whose purpose is the impediment of procreation, but it is emphasized that direct sterilization cannot occur when it comes to the moral certainty that that uterus, because of its conditions , cannot carry on a pregnancy until the viability of the fetus. In fact, an intervention that affects a uterus that is objectively incapable of carrying out its natural function cannot be qualified as anti-procreative.",0,1283
1523,"CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old man went to the emergency department the day after exposure to a laser pointer. Funduscopy revealed dispersed macular pigment alterations, and optical coherence tomography showed a disruption of the retinal layers. The visual acuity was counting fingers in both eyes. Nine months later, optical coherence tomography angiography showed a rarefaction in the choriocapillaris vascular flow in the area of the laser injuries. DISCUSSION: The retinal layer mainly damaged by the laser injury was the retinal pigment epithelium. However, it is suggested that the laser injury could involve tissues beyond the retinal pigment epithelium, since a rarefaction of the choriocapillaris was found after exposure to the laser.",0,740
1524,"Isotretinoin is the most effective drug in the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodulocystic acne. However, treatment with this drug is associated with adverse effects, the most severe being teratogenesis. It has been estimated that 40% of pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin present spontaneous abortion and 35% develop embryopathy. We present the case of a newborn with a history of prenatal exposure to isotretinoin, a clinical entity that can be avoided, with severe congenital defects in the central nervous system and important facial dysmorphisms, with unfavorable clinical course.",0,588
1525,"A 30 year-old man with acute myeloblastic leukaemia and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome developed graft-versus-host disease. The patient was treated with ruxolitinib. After being treated for 3 months with ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase, he developed Aspergillus retinal necrosis resistant to common treatment. Treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors may lead to an increased incidence of opportunistic infections. Janus kinase inhibitor administration may result in poor treatment efficacy.",0,503
1526,"Coronaviruses have been demonstrated to contribute substantially to respiratory tract infections among the child population. Though infected children commonly present mild upper airway symptoms, in high-risk patients with underlying conditions, particularly in immunocompromised children these pathogens may lead to severe lung infection and extrapulmonary disorders. In this paper, we provide the first report of the case of a 15-month-old child with severe combined immunodeficiency and coronavirus HKU1-related pneumonia with fatal respiratory distress syndrome.",1,565
1527,"The paradoxical response to tuberculosis treatment consists in the appearance of new clinical or radiologic manifestations or worsening of previous injuries after an initial improvement with anti-tuberculosis therapy. It can be observed in 6 to 30 percent of the cases of tubercular meningitis. It is the consequence of an exaggerated immune reaction that should be considered since the treatment is based on the use of immunomodulators and not in the change of anti-tuberculous drugs. We present the case of an HIV negative adult with tuberculous meningitis with a good initial response to specific therapy who showed, 10 weeks later, a paradoxical reaction to treatment that responded successfully to corticosteroids.",0,719
1528,"ANCA mediated vasculitis mainly occur between the fourth and fifth decade of life; therefore, it is very uncommon to see pregnant patients with the disease. Vasculitis may affect significantly the course of pregnancy; in turn pregnancy can change the course of vasculitis. We report a 20 years old woman with ANCA-mediated renal vasculitis lasting 10 years who consulted with a pregnancy of 15 weeks. She was in remission and had amenorrhea attributed to ovarian toxicity due to cyclophosphamide. Pregnancy had an uneventful course with spontaneous delivery at the 37th week, giving birth to a healthy newborn. Proteinuria increased during the course of pregnancy with a mild deterioration of kidney function. During the year after delivery, she had nephrotic proteinuria and a worsening of renal function.",0,806
1529,"Airway injury caused by double-lumen tubes is a rare but potentially serious complication. We describe the case of a patient who had a bronchial rupture during one-lung ventilation with left double-lumen tube, complicated with a secondary cardiac arrest. She had a full recovery without sequelae. Underlying causes of the patient were a history of radiotherapy, and a possible overinflation of bronchial cuff, that it could contribute to the development of this complication. The possible airway injury should be considered by all practitioners who employ double-lumen tubes for the care of their patients.",0,606
1530,"Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies during childhood along with cow's milk allergy. The measles-mumpsrubella (MMR) vaccine is included in the pediatric immunization schedule and contains egg protein. The currently accepted opinion is that the MMR vaccination should be done in a single dose under medical observation in patients with egg allergy. Although it is reported that the MMR vaccine is safe for that patients, there are some patients who developed anaphylaxis. Generally, the development of anaphylaxis after the previous vaccination is reported as a contraindication. We present a successful administration of MMR vaccine by gradually increased doses for a patient who developed anaphylaxis after the previous vaccination.",0,749
1531,"Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent parasitic disease of the central nervous system. It is caused by the larvae of Taenia solium, which can affect different anatomical sites. In Spain there is an increasing prevalence mainly due to immigration from endemic areas. The extraparenchymal forms are less common, but more serious because they usually develop complications. Neuroimaging plays a major role in the diagnosis and follow-up of this disease, supported by serology and a compatible clinical and epidemiological context. First-line treatments are cysticidal drugs such as albendazole and praziquantel, usually coadministered with corticosteroids, and in some cases surgery is indicated. We here report a case of neurocysticercosis with simultaneous intraventricular and giant racemose subarachnoid involvement.",0,819
1532,"CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old woman with a history of bilateral retinal pigment epithelium detachment (PED), secondary of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), who presented with a retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tear on her left eye after an aflibercept injection in the contralateral eye one month earlier. DISCUSSION: A RPE tear is the main complication when the anti-VEGF therapy is used for the management of the PED. Furthermore, it should be noted that systemic absorption of the drug can induce an effect on the untreated eye.",0,534
1533,"Eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE) is an uncommon eosinophilic dermatosis. Clinically it is characterized by recurrent episodes of annular or figurative plaques. The histopathological study shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial and deep dermis, composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils. It was originally described in children. We report an adult woman who presented with recurrent erythematous annular plaques on the trunk and extremities. A biopsy showed a mainly perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with numerous eosinophils in the dermis. Laboratory examinations revealed subclinical hypothyroidism. The lesions resolved with topical corticosteroid spontaneously after 3 months.",0,708

A favourable response was achieved with oral methotrexate treatment.",0,610
1535,"CASE REPORT: A patient with a left optic nerve coloboma with late development (at 15 years of age) of vitreoretinal fibrovascular proliferation and tractional retinal detachment (TRD). Sectorial retinal photocoagulation was performed with regression of the proliferative tissue and exudation. DISCUSSION: Congenital optic nerve anomalies may be associated with significant retinal avascularity, ischaemia and late fibrovascular proliferation. Laser is effective for regression of the neovascular tissue and preventing TRD progression.",0,534
1536,"Resumen: Introduction: Trichobezoars are an intraluminal accumulation of ingested hair. The Rapunzel syndrome refers to the presence of gastric trichobezoars which extend to the small intestine together with trichotillomania and trichophagia, that occur predominantly in psychiatric patients of pediatric age. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical course and resolution of this syndrome in a case report. Likewise, we provide information about the family environment and psycho-emotional context of the patients and help the reader identify similar circumstances in their clinical practice. CASE REPORT: Female 14-year-old patient with history of trichotillomania and trichophagia of two years of evolution, who consulted for epigastric pain associated with weight loss, nausea, and postprandial fullness. During the physical examination, the patient was found to have bald patches in the scalp along with a palpable mass that seemed to be confined to the gastric limits. Imaging studies revealed gastric occupation due to a bezoar formation. The patient was treated surgically with laparotomy and gastrostomy, and two simultaneous trichobezoars were removed from the patient s stomach and duodenum, the patient also underwent psycho-emotional professional counseling. CONCLUSION: Rapunzel s syndrome, far for being a merely surgical entity, also requires psychoemotional assessment to prevent it recurrence and limit its severity.",0,1428
1537,"Nicolau syndrome (NS) is a rare complication of intramuscular, intraarticular or subcutaneous injection of particular drugs leading to ischemic necrosis of the surrounding skin, soft tissue and muscular tissue. Benzathine penicilin one of the most widely used antibiotic for upper respiratory tract infections and has been rarely reported to cause NS. Here we describe a 4 year old boy with diagnosis of NS after the injection of benzathine penicillin who was successfuly treated with unfractionized heparin (enoxaparine) and pentoxifylline. The practitioners should pay attention for unnecessary use of benzathine penicillin to avoid from probable complications.",0,663
1538,Injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament are currently treated primarily with the use of hamstring graft with a wide range of different techniques and fixation systems for anterior cruciate ligament in reducing patient morbidity. We report the case of a female patient aged 42 that suffered an anterior cruciate ligament rupture and was treated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring autograft with femoral fixation with bio-absorbable cross-pin and tibial fixation with bio-absorbable screw. The patient presented lateral knee pain that was diagnosed one year after the operation as an iliotibial band friction syndrome. Imaging studies were performed. X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated adequate fixation of the anterior cruciate ligament with the presence of migration and rupture of the proximal bio-absorbable cross-pin. It was decided to remove the bio-absorbable cross-pin fragment in a second surgical procedure after which the patient went back to her daily activities and sports without pain and with stability stable knee.,0,1074
1539,CDC continues to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to investigate cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This report updates information on reported SARS cases worldwide and among U.S. residents and summarizes information on one additional case with laboratory evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).,1,374
1540,"AIM: To describe the characteristics of type 1 choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) using two different optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) devices sequentially during a standard protocol of three intravitreal injections of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). METHODS: The study included 6 eyes with naive neovascular ARMD. Macular OCT-A images were acquired using AngioPlex Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, USA) and DRI OCT Triton SS-OCT Angio (Topcon, Medical Systems, Inc. Oakland, NJ, USA). The macular OCT-A scan covered an area of 3x3mm. Distinct morphological patterns and quantifiable features of the neovascular membranes were studied on en face projection images, which were taken at different stages of the follow-up. RESULTS: Treatment response could be estimated using the OCT-A criteria of CNV activity. Higher activity scores before treatment resulted in a greater decrease in the membrane area. The estimated net decline in area ranged from 83.5% to 1.4%. The OCT-A performed one-week after treatment revealed the greatest area reductions. CONCLUSIONS: OCT-A provides new possibilities for the non-invasive assessment of features of neovascular networks and CNV structural morphology. Newly described activity criteria can also guide therapeutic decisions, and help in evaluating responses. Quantitative and qualitative information can be provided with this technique. However, further software development and future investigation are essential to define the role of this tool on a daily basis.",0,1606
1541,"INTRODUCTION: Transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) typically arises as an autonomic neuropathy primarily affecting small fibres and it occurs in adult patients in their second or third decades of life. It progresses rapidly and can lead to death in approximately 10 years. Other phenotypes have been described in non-endemic areas. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We described 4 cases from the Spanish province of Guipuzcoa, a non-endemic area, to highlight the clinical variability of this disease. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: Three patients presented a late-onset form manifesting after the age of 50, featuring a predominantly motor polyneuropathy initially causing distal impairment of the lower limbs followed by the upper limbs. One patient suffered severe neuropathic pain. None showed signs of autonomic involvement. The fourth patient, of Portuguese descent, presented a typical form with onset in her thirties, neuropathic pain and dysautonomia. All patients carry the Val50Met mutation in the TTR gene. CONCLUSION: FAP is a pleomorphic disease even in patients carrying the same mutation. In non-endemic areas, its main form of presentation may resemble a predominantly motor polyneuropathy developing in the sixth decade of life with no signs of dysautonomia. Given this non-specific presentation and the widely available technical means of studying the TTR gene, we believe that the protocol for the aetiological diagnosis of any polyneuropathy should include genetic sequencing of TTR.",0,1512
1542,"OBJECTIVE: There is the possibility of diagnosing azoospermia in cases of testicular tumours in patients who wish to preserve fertility. Our objective is to present a technique for obtaining spermatozoa from testicles with ex vivo tumours in order to preserve fertility in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 34-year-old patient was referred for azoospermia. The physical examination revealed a node in the lower pole of the left testicle. In the scrotal ultrasound, the testicle presented disperse microcalcifications and a 1-cm hypoechoic mass in the lower pole. The tumour markers were negative, and the CT showed no distant disease. Left radical orchiectomy was performed, along with the placement of a testis prosthesis. Bench surgery was then performed, with extraction of the seminiferous tubules in the upper pole. RESULTS: Of the submitted samples, 4 progressive and 1 nonprogressive motile spermatozoa were identified per field. Two samples were cryopreserved. The pathological report indicated the presence of a seminoma measuring 1.3 x 1 cm, with free margins and with no invasion of the rete testis (stage I). An assisted reproduction technique (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) was performed on the patient's partner with the frozen spermatozoa, which resulted in pregnancy and the subsequent birth of a healthy child. CONCLUSION: We propose this technique as the method of choice for obtaining spermatozoa from patients who simultaneously present azoospermia and testicular tumours and who wish to preserve their fertility.",0,1543
1543,Candida haemulonii forms part of the non-albicans Candida species. The candidemia caused by C. haemulonii is extremely rare but fatal in neonates. We reported the first two neonates with C. haemulonii candidemia in China which were treated with fluconazole and reviewed two papers previously reported. Our report adds further awareness on C. haemulonii candidemia in critical neonates and points out the importance of an early diagnosis and treatment of this fatal infection.,0,475
1544,"Most studies about treatment of inflammatory myopathies consist of cross-sectional analyses that do not assess long-term efficacy. In the present study we describe the follow-up of seven patients with inflammatory myopathies, 5 polymyositis and 2 dermatomyositis. We describe their clinical features, follow-up, muscle enzyme levels, and treatment responses. We define the latter as treatment cycles, every one of which end when steroid doses need to be increased or a new immunosuppressive drug has to be added because of clinical worsening or sustained increases in muscle enzyme levels. Treatment can cause remission, partially control, or fail in achieving myositis improvement when it normalizes, stabilizes, or does not affect muscle enzymes or clinical features, respectively. We analyzed 20 cycles, in which remission was achieved in 14 cases, partial control in 5 instances, and treatment failure in one case. Remission occurred after an average of 139 +/- 98 days, whereas partial control took place in 160 +/- 100 days. Except in one case, all treatment cycles controlled or remitted the symptoms. However, in all patients the illness recurred with time.",0,1165
1545,"Postoperative respiratory insufficiency is a serious complication of total thyroidectomies which can be multifactorial, especially in children. We report two siblings who had undergone thyroidectomy with subsequent respiratory distress. Electrothermal bipolar and harmonic scalpel were used during thyroid dissections. Both patients had early postoperative respiratory problems. The older one suffered from mild respiratory distress for 24 hours and then he spontaneously recovered. The younger one was extubated but then she had serious stridor accompanied with abdominal and intercostal retractions. She was re-intubated and admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilatory support, where she stayed for 14 days due to multiple failed extubation attempts. The symptoms were more severe in the younger child probably due to softer tracheal wall and weaker tracheal cartilages. We should keep in mind the probable postoperative respiratory complications due to thermal injury or inappropriate surgical technique after thyroid surgeries.",0,1030
1546,"Zoonotic infections with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus have been reported occasionally in individuais with exposure to farm animals, especially horses.

1547,"BACKGROUND: From the available literature, it is demonstrated that dematiaceous fungal infections mostly affect immunosuppressed patients. These infections can occur in different forms, from subcutaneous infection to disseminated forms that may compromise the life of the patient. In many cases the infection is related to the inoculation of the microorganism by diverse traumatic mechanisms, which determines the course of the infection to be slower in some cases. CASE REPORT: We describe two cases of phaeohyphomycosis caused by Phaeoacremonium parasiticum: A cancer patient with subcutaneous lesions affecting the left hand and forearm, and a patient who presented with subcutaneous abscesses in the left leg. CONCLUSIONS: These cases confirm the presence of this type of fungus in Spain. In the second case a combination of amphotericin B lipid complex and posaconazole, together with several surgical resections, were necessary in order to overcome the infection.",0,969
1548,"Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is uncommon and predominantly seen in women. More than 6% of eosinophils in peripheral blood and more than 25% in bronchoalveolar lavage are diagnostic criteria. Secondary causes of hypereosinophilic pneumonia must be ruled out. We report a 72-year-old non-smoker man presenting in the emergency room with a history of cough, fever, and moderate dyspnea. He was not taking any medication. A chest-X ray showed a left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia. There was no improvement after therapy. A chest CT scan showed increased LLL consolidation and new left upper lobe ground glass opacities as well as a moderate left pleural effusion. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage showed 95% eosinophils, and had negative cultures. No parasites were identified. Transbronchial biopsies demonstrated eosinophil accumulation in alveoli and interstitium and pleural fluid was composed by 85% eosinophils. With the diagnosis of CEP, systemic corticosteroids were used with favorable clinical and radiological response.",0,1154
1549,"We report a case of acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy in an 18-month-old boy after an episode of otitis media. The clinical presentation begins with skin erythematous macules on the thighs, followed by purpuric lesions in arms, legs, and ankle edema. It was initially interpreted as urticaria, whereby steroids were indicated. However, the clinical feature was acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, a benign leukocytoclastic vasculitis that occurs in children between 4 and 24 months of age and is characterized by fever, large purpuric palpable target-like skin lesions affecting the face, lobes of the ears, limbs and frequently associated with edema. Differential diagnosis includes erythema multiforme, hemorrhagic urticaria, drug- induced vasculitis, Kawasaki disease, infected eczema, sepsis (either meningococcal or non-meningococcal) and child abuse. Some of them have risk of mortality. Management is conservative, however, steroids may be a therapeutic option.",0,969
1550,"BACKGROUND: The coexistence of hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia, a clinical entity known as painful tic convulsive, was first described in 1910. It is an uncommon condition that is worthy of interest in neurosurgical practice, because of its common pathophysiology mechanism: Neuro-vascular compression in most of the cases. OBJECTIVE: To present 2 cases of painful tic convulsive that received treatment at our institution, and to give a brief review of the existing literature related to this. The benefits of micro-surgical decompression and the most common medical therapy used (botulin toxin) are also presented. CLINICAL CASES: Two cases of typical painful tic convulsive are described, showing representative slices of magnetic resonance imaging corresponding to the aetiology of each case, as well as a description of the surgical technique employed in our institution. The immediate relief of symptomatology, and the clinical condition at one-year follow-up in each case is described. A brief review of the literature on this condition is presented. CONCLUSION: This very rare neurological entity represents less than 1% of rhizopathies and in a large proportion of cases it is caused by vascular compression, attributed to an aberrant dolichoectatic course of the vertebro-basilar complex. The standard modality of treatment is micro-vascular surgical decompression, which has shown greater effectiveness and control of symptoms in the long-term. However medical treatment, which includes percutaneous infiltration of botulinum toxin, has produced similar results at medium-term in the control of each individual clinical manifestation, but it must be considered as an alternative in the choice of treatment.",0,1727
1551,"Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the virus. However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non-consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non-consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% +/- 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% +/- 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.",1,1943
1552,"INTRODUCTION: The ataxia telangiectasia syndrome (AT) is a genetic disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with multisystem involvement and a broad clinical spectrum. It is caused by the mutation of the ATM gene, causing reduction or absence of the ATM proteinkinase, altering processes in the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. The objective of this article is to report the case of a patient with ataxia telangiectasia syndrome, caused by a mutation not previously reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: A 14 year-old patient native to Colombia, with classic clinical and phenotypical manifestations of AT syndrome, which started at 6 years of age with pondostatural alteration, recurrent respiratory infections, oculocutaneus telangiectasias and progressive neurological disorder that included: regression in her psychomotor development, ataxia and oculomotor apraxia. ATM gene sequencing is performed evidencing a homozygous mutation not reported in literature. DISCUSSION: In Latin America are sparse the number of reports of patients with ataxia telangiectasia and only few of these describe their molecular findings. Molecular studies allow the diagnosis and a better orientation in the management and prognosis of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The report of undescribed molecular variants is of great importance to establish the etiology of such diseases in diverse population groups, such as the countries of Latin America.",0,1466
1553,"In 2012, a novel coronavirus, initially named as human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) but recently renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in patients who suffered severe acute respiratory infection and subsequent renal failure that resulted in death. Ongoing epidemiological investigations together with retrospective studies have found 61 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with this novel coronavirus, including 34 deaths to date. This novel coronavirus is culturable and two complete genome sequences are now available. Furthermore, molecular detection and indirect immunofluorescence assay have been developed. The present paper summarises the limited recent advances of this novel human coronavirus, including its discovery, genomic characterisation and detection.",1,820
1554,"INTRODUCTION: Vigabatrin (VGB) is a first-line drug for the treatment of infantile spasms. Recently, several reports claim the existence of abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (particularly affecting basal ganglia, and visible in T2 and diffusion sequences) in infants with spasms that were receiving high doses of VGB (> 100 mg/kg/day), which appear to be reversible after withdrawal of treatment. CASE REPORTS: We present two cases with an epileptic encephalopathy in the first year of life and seizures consisting of infantile spasms. Both were treated with several antiepileptic drugs, including VGB up to a maximum dosage of 200 mg/kg/day. At the age of 11 and 28 months, respectively, MRI images showed marked signal hyperintensities on T2-sequences on bilateral globus pallidus, thalamus, posterior portion of the brainstem and dentate nuclei, also visible on diffusion sequences. Both had previous unaltered MRI studies. After excluding an underlying metabolic disease, VGB withdrawal is decided, appreciating the reversibility of those lesions in a prospective MRI study, three months later. CONCLUSIONS: We must consider and carefully evaluate findings on brain MRI in infants receiving VGB at high doses for treatment of spasms. The apparent cytotoxic effect on basal ganglia could simulate metabolic/mitochondrial diseases. By knowing this effect of VGB and its typical MRI features, unnecessary testing can be avoided in young infants with epileptic encephalopathies, including complex procedures like muscle biopsy or a new metabolic screening.",0,1572
1555,"INTRODUCTION: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2-3% of adult solid malignancies. About 25-30% develop metastasis at the time of diagnosis and 60% corresponds to clear cell type. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old man, with a personal history of left radical nephrectomy, presents with an asymptomatic skin tumor he noticed one month earlier. Histopathologic study reported metastatic cutaneous infiltration of clear cell carcinoma, suggestive of a primary renal carcinoma. DISCUSSION: Cutaneous metastasis of RCC represents 6.0-6.8% of all cutaneous metastases. These patients have poor prognosis and, therefore, their treatment is palliative. It is essential to perform a complete periodic dermatologic examination for proper restaging and treatment.",0,756
1556,A 21-year-old man was seen for follow-up of optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) in the ophthalmology department. Funduscopy revealed the presence of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in the papillomacular bundle of his right eye (RE). The patient was successfully treated with two intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). Peri-papillary choroidal neovascularisation in papillomacular bundle is a rare complication in patients with ONHD. These forms of CNV show a good response to anti-VEGF treatment.,0,535
1557,"Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common form of sustained regular narrow QRS complex tachycardia. It is caused by the presence of a dual atrioventricular nodal anatomy and physiology, with a fast and a slow pathway forming a substrate for re-entry. Electrophysiology study confirms the diagnosis when the tachycardia is induced, although in some cases this is not possible. Casuistry is here presented where the application of radiofrequency induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, when the electrophysiological study could not do it; we explain here its electrophysiological mechanism.",0,624
1558,"A novel betacoronavirus associated with lethal respiratory and renal complications was recently identified in patients from several countries in the Middle East. We report the deep genome sequencing of the virus directly from a patient's sputum sample. Our high-throughput sequencing yielded a substantial depth of genome sequence assembly and showed the minority viral variants in the specimen. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome (England/Qatar/2012) revealed its close relationship to European bat coronaviruses circulating among the bat species of the Vespertilionidae family. Molecular clock analysis showed that the 2 human infections of this betacoronavirus in June 2012 (EMC/2012) and September 2012 (England/Qatar/2012) share a common virus ancestor most likely considerably before early 2012, suggesting the human diversity is the result of multiple zoonotic events.",1,891

A 65 year-old male, without previous hepatopathy, who consulted due to right hypochondrial pain with a subacute evolution. The pathological diagnosis was adult epithelial hepatoblastoma, with free surgical margins. The patient recei-ved a second surgical intervention 5 months later due to early recurrence and died 10 months after the diagnosis due to a new massive recurrence. His definitive diagnosis is histological. Radical surgery is the only treatment that increases survival, but recurrence is frequent.

1560,"High abdominal wall surgery may require general anesthesia but, in patients with high risk of difficult airway and respiratory complications, local or regional anesthesia is the choice whenever possible. Spinal anesthesia usually used (both isobaric and hyperbaric) could compromise the respiratory function due to blockade of the T6 metamere or higher. Hypobaric spinal anesthesia (HSA) at low doses (3.6 cc of 0.1% hypobaric bupivacaine plus 0.2 cc of 0.005% fentanyl) achieves sufficient analgesia with minimal motor blockade. We present the case of a patient with a large supraumbilical hernia with high risk of difficult airway and respiratory complications, who went through HSA. The patient did not report pain or dyspnea during the surgical procedure thus, HSA at low doses is an option to be taken into account in high abdominal wall surgery despite not having been described for this use.",0,898
1561,"BACKGROUND: Chylopericardium is a rare occurrence in children. The most common causes are associated with cardiac surgery, malformations of the lymphatic system, idiopathic reasons, among others. OBJECTIVE: The case is presented of a patient with traumatic chylopericardium, the diagnostic methodology, and in particular, its successful resolution by surgical means. CLINICAL CASE: Male patient of 6 years old, previous accident of fall from patient's height. Chest x-ray showed evidence of cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram with pericardial effusion was performed. Pericardial puncture was performed with drainage of milky material, confirming chylous liquid. Treatment included pericardial catheterisation, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, and diet with medium chain triglycerides, with persistent increased pericardial fluid. Lymphatic abnormalities were ruled out by MRI. He underwent surgical treatment due to failure of prior treatment. A thoracoscopic approach was adopted with a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Chylopericardium occurs in children in most cases after cardiovascular surgery. The case presented here was classified as idiopathic. Patients with this condition may present with severe symptoms, such as tamponade, or can be asymptomatic as in the case presented. If medical treatment fails, it should be resolved by surgery; the best choice is minimally invasive treatment with its well-known advantages.",0,1431
1562,"OBJECTIVE: Intraneural cysts are benign lesions located within the epineurium of some peripheral nerves and their aetiopathogenesis is controversial. Most are located at the level of the lower limbs. In the upper limbs, the most frequently affected nerve is the ulnar nerve. Suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome due to the formation of an intraneural cyst is rare. In this article, we show a new case and perform a literature review of intraneural cysts located in the suprascapular nerve. METHODS: We present a 49-year-old woman with pain in the lateral shoulder region of several months' evolution. A brachial plexus MR showed a tumour of approximately 2x1.5cm, with a cystic appearance, in relation to the upper trunk of the right brachial plexus. RESULTS: We used a supra-infraclavicular approach. The cystic tumour affected the suprascapular nerve. After locating a zone on the surface without nervous fascicles, we performed a partial resection of the capsule and emptying of the cyst, with a xanthochromic gelatinous content. The anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intraneural cyst. CONCLUSION: The suprascapular nerve is a mixed nerve, coming from the upper trunk. It provides the motor branches to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle. Compression of the suprascapular nerve leads to atrophy of these muscles. This entity is one of the differential diagnoses in a patient with pain irradiating to the shoulder, and its correct treatment often results in complete remission of symptoms.",0,1527
1563,"BACKGROUND: The presence of multiple symptomatic pulmonary nodules and one cardiac tumour in a child requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Until a few decades ago, the diagnosis of a cardiac tumour was difficult and was based on a high index of suspicion from indirect signs, and required angiocardiography for confirmation. Echocardiography and other imaging techniques have also helped in the detection of cardiac neoplasms. However, it is not always easy to make the correct diagnosis. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 12 year-old boy with pulmonary symptoms, and diagnosed with a cardiac tumour with lung metastases. The presence of numerous pulmonary nodules was confirmed in our hospital. The echocardiogram detected a solid cardiac nodule in the right ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the findings and the diagnosis. Puncture-aspiration of a lung nodule gave the diagnosis of hydatidosis. He underwent open-heart surgery with cardiac cyst resection and treated with anthelmintics. The lung cysts were then excised, and he recovered uneventfully. DISCUSSION: This child had multiple pulmonary nodules and a solid cardiac nodule, and was suspected of having a cardiac tumour with pulmonary metastases. However, given the clinical history, background and morphology of pulmonary nodules, another possible aetiology for consideration is echinococcosis. The clinical picture of cardiac hydatidosis and its complications is highly variable. The clinical history is essential in these cases, as well as having a high index of suspicion. CONCLUSION: Hydatidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of a solid, echogenic, cardiac nodule. The treatment for cardiopulmonary hydatid cysts is surgical, followed by anthelmintics.",0,1763
1564,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are rare mucocutaneous diseases which are associated with a prolonged course and potentially lethal outcome. They are mostly drug induced and mortality rates are very high. Although mostly skin is involved, multiple organ systems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and urinary systems may be affected. Here, we report a case of Stevens- Johnson Syndrome associated with methotrexate treatment who developed acute cardiac failure and gastrointestinal hemorrhage beside skin findings. He had been treated with intravenous immunglobulin and methylprednisolone succesfully and continued chemotherapy with methotrexate treatment again.",0,704
1565,"CLINICAL CASE: A 45 year-old woman with unknown ophthalmology history complained of pain, redness and visual acuity (VA) loss in her left eye for the last three weeks. A serous iris cyst with an overlying peripheral corneal leukoma was located in the iris stroma using ultrasonic biomicroscopy. It was assumed that it was secondary to a penetrating trauma from her childhood. The cyst healed and VA improved after fine-needle aspiration and partial posterior synechiolysis. DISCUSSION: Iris inclusion cysts may appear many years after penetrating trauma or surgery. Fine-needle aspiration is a good choice for its diagnosis and treatment.",0,638
1566,"We report a 74-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension, who recently underwent coronary bypass surgery due to severe triple vessel disease receiving cardiological and combined antidiabetic therapy, including metformin 4 g/day. He was admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of consciousness. At admission, he was disoriented and agitated with signs of poor perfusion. His blood pressure was 80/70 mmHg, pulse rate 40 beats/min, respiratory rate 20-breaths/min, and axillary temperature 35 degrees C. Biochemical profile revealed an extreme hyperkalemia of 15.4 mEq/L (double checked), elevated creatinine, uremia and brain natriuretic peptide; hypoglycemia (blood glucose 68 mg/dl) and normal C Reactive Protein. Arterial blood gases revealed severe lactic acidemia. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, simple AV block, widened QRS with prominent T wave and prolonged QT. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the suspicion of lactic acidosis associated with metformin, receiving fluid management, intravenous hypertonic glucose plus insulin and sodium bicarbonate, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, a temporary pacemaker lead, in addition to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Two days later, the patient experienced a significant clinical improvement with normalization of the acid-base status, plasma lactate and potassium levels. On day 9, diuresis was recovered, creatinine and uremia returned to normal levels and the patient was discharged from the ICU.",0,1551
1567,"INTRODUCTION: The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia is characterised by progressive social, cognitive and personality deterioration associated with several molecular pathologies of frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD): FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-FUS. Its diagnosis requires pathological studies. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old male, with a three-year progressive history of behavioural disorder, apathy, poor language skills, perseveration, lack of empathy, bulimia and executive dysfunction. Neuroimaging revealed right-dominant frontal cortical atrophy, and a single-photon emission tomography brain scan showed bilateral frontal hypoperfusion with thalamic and caudate involvement. Clinically, he was diagnosed with probable frontotemporal dementia, behavioural variant. On his death, his brain was donated to the Neurological Tissue Bank and the neuropathological diagnosis was corticobasal degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Corticobasal degeneration is one of the FTLD-tau tauopathies. The 2013 diagnostic criteria for corticobasal degeneration include executive dysfunction and behavioural and personality disorders similar to those of this patient as a clinical phenotype. The anatomoclinical case presented illustrates the absence of any correlation between the clinical phenotype and the underlying neuropathological diagnosis in frontotemporal dementia, and the need to conduct a histopathological study in order to reach a definitive diagnosis.",0,1458
1568,"INTRODUCTION: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is an infrequent hypomyelinating disorder caused by alterations in the PLP1 gene, which leads to a fault in the axonal myelination of the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Two forms have been reported, according to the severity of the presentation: connatal and classic. It is characterised by neonatal hypotonia, delayed psychomotor development, progressive spasticity predominantly in the lower limbs and nystagmus, with pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and symptoms; the connatal form is far more severe. Magnetic resonance imaging shows diffuse hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy, evoked potentials are usually altered and confirmation is obtained through a molecular study of the PLP1 gene. CASE REPORTS: We present the cases of five paediatric patients, four of whom had the classic form and one with the connatal form. The clinical characteristics and complementary studies are described, and a concise review of the literature is carried out. CONCLUSION: This disease has a progressive and almost unvarying course, which is the clinical key to be able to differentiate it from other entities such as infantile cerebral palsy, peripheral neuropathies or multiple sclerosis, among others, in addition to the characteristic neuroimaging findings. It is necessary to suspect this diagnosis and confirm alterations in the PLP1 gene with the aim of obtaining a real incidence of this entity, which is probably underestimated, like other leukodystrophies.",0,1516
1569,"CASE REPORT: A case is presented of a 63-year-old man who suffered a unilateral isolated trochlear nerve palsy with vertical diplopia following an elective radial coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, which resolved spontaneously within 2 months. DISCUSSION: Ophthalmoplegia following coronary percutaneous angioplasty is rare. Only internuclear ophthalmoplegia, III and VI cranial nerve palsy have been previously reported following percutaneous angioplasty. This is the first reported case of unilateral isolated trochlear nerve ophthalmoplegia following this procedure.",0,595
1570,"INTRODUCTION: A chikungunya outbreak took place in the State of Yucatan starting in the second half of 2015 OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical course of a case of chikungunya in a previously healthy infant, providing practical evidence to guide future diagnoses and treatment during outbreak seasons in endemic areas CASE REPORT: Clinical manifestation started with a sudden onset of fever and a diffuse macular-papillary erythema, originally treated in the community with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Two days later, the fever relapsed with hypoactivity, severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (without lymphopenia), respiratory distress, liver dysfunction, sepsis, followed by septic shock with a fatal outcome. IgM test was positive to chikungunya, while her mother tested negative. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the blood culture possible due to contamination, without ruling out the possibility of a mixed origin sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Chikungunya is a disease in which the manifestations in neonates and young infants can be severe, and even fatal. It is important to suspect it in this age group at risk of vector contact, in the presence of fever without apparent source of infection and cutaneous manifestations. It is important to use the antipyretics cautiously, considering the possibility of aggravating the underlying infection, and the potential hepatic and haematological damage.",0,1415
1571,"OBJECTIVE: Fractures involving the capitellum can be treated surgically by excision of the fragment, or by reduction and internal fixation with screws, with or without heads. The lateral Kocher approach is the most common approach for open reduction. We believe that the limited anterior approach of the elbow, could be a valid technique for treating these fractures, as it does not involve the detachment of any muscle group or ligament, facilitating the recovery process. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A description is presented of the surgical technique, as well as of 2cases with a Bryan-Morrey type 1 fracture (Dubberley type 1A). Two different final quality of life evaluation questionnaires were completed by telephone: the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the patient part of the Liverpool Elbow Score (PAQ-LES) questionnaire. RESULTS: The 2patients showed favourable clinical progress at 36 and 24 months, respectively, with an extension/flexion movement arc of -5 degrees /145 degrees and -10 degrees /145 degrees , as well as a pronosupination of 85 degrees /80 degrees and 90 degrees /90 degrees . The 2patients showed radiological consolidation with no signs of osteonecrosis. The EQ-5D score was 0.857 and 0.910 (range: 0.36-1), and a PAQ-SLE of 35 and 35 (range: 17-36), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the limited anterior approach of the elbow is a technical option to consider for the open surgical treatment of a capitellum fracture, although further studies are needed to demonstrate its superiority and clinical safety compared to the classical lateral Kocher approach.",0,1610

1573,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare complication associated with the use of calcineurin inhibitors in lung transplantation, irrespective of the underlying disease of the graft recipient. It usually occurs in incomplete forms, complicating and delaying diagnosis until damage is already irreversible. It is unrelated to time from transplantation and often presents with concomitant infection, which tends to confound diagnosis. The cases discussed here have a common causative agent and all present with concomitant infection. Treatment recommendations have changed in recent years with the introduction of plasmapheresis or, more recently, the availability of the antibody eculizumab. Notwithstanding, the most cost-effective measure is withdrawal or switching of the calcineurin inhibitor. TMA is an underdiagnosed clinical entity that should be considered in the management of transplantation patients.",0,911
1574,"Pleuropulmonary Blastoma corresponds to a malignant primary lung disorder, exclusive of pediatric age, infrequent and of aggressive characteristics. Age on diagnosis is 1 month-12 years. Rates per sex are equal. It can be found inside pleura or lungs. Respiratory distress associated or not with pneumothorax, chest pain and fever are classical clinical signs. These symptoms could be misdiagnosed as pneumonia. Radiologically, a large mass near the pleura at the base of the right lung without air bronchogram is its most common form. It has three histological types: type I (cystic), type II (mixed) and type III (solid). Its treatment requires tumor excision and multimodal chemotherapy. Pleuropulmonary Blastoma type I has good prognosis; type II and III variants have lower survival. We report a 2-year-old girl, pointing to the clinicalradiological diagnosis.",0,865
1575,"The Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease characterized by the clonal proliferation of CD1a + myeloid dendritic cells associated with a significant inflammatory component. The localized form of the disease is called eosinophilic granuloma. Bone involvement is common; in children, lytic lesions are most frequently found in the cranial dome being rare in the orbit. We present an 18-month-old infant who consulted due to periorbital edema and proptosis of the right eye, with two months of evolution. The computed tomography and the magnetic resonance imaging showed a maxillary sinus tumor mass of expansive growth and erosion of the roof of the orbit. The biopsy confirmed CD1a+ proliferation; it was treated with prednisone and vinblastine with favorable evolution. It is a rare entity that requires a high index of suspicion and multidisciplinary management. Early diagnosis and treatment leads to a favorable prognosis for the patient.",0,950
1576,"INTRODUCTION: Scarlet fever is a common illness in pediatrics caused by group A beta-hemolytic strep tococcus (GABHS), which usually occurs after an episode of pharyngitis, and has an overall excellent prognosis. Hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever is a rare complication described in adults and even less frequently in children. Our objective was to describe a case of hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever in a pediatric patient. CLINICAL CASE: A 12-year-old male with scarlet fever presented with a 4-day history of jaundice, dark urine, and decreased appetite. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzy mes and total and direct bilirubin levels, and negative studies for hepatitis A, B and C, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus B19, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus-6, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. Abdominal ultrasound examination was normal. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of scarlet fever associated hepatitis remains unclear. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin mediated cellular injury via cytokine production has been proposed as a possible mechanism of hepatotoxicity in GABHS infections. CONCLUSION: Hepatitis secondary to scarlet fever remains a rare but benign entity, with complete recovery expected over weeks to months.",0,1250
1577,"We report a 64 years old female admitted with fever, cough, dyspnea and lung opacities in the chest X ray. A chest tomography scan (CTS) showed multiple-bilateral ring-shaped opacities and the reversed halo sign (RHS). The patient did not improve with antimicrobial therapy (AT). Infection and rheumatologic causes were excluded, therefore Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) was suspected with compatible percutaneous biopsy. Systemic steroids were started with a good clinical response. The patient was discharged four weeks after admission in good general conditions and practically no lungs opacities.",0,608
1578,"Complement-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a rare progressive glomerular disease. In some patients it can be associated with retinal lesions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess a case series with this diagnosis in our hospital. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 8 patients diagnosed with complement-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Funduscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Swept Source domain OCT angiography were performed. Only 1 of the 8 patients showed drusen-like deposits that were located under the retinal pigment epithelium in the OCT, with the presence of associated choroidal neovascularization being ruled out in OCT angiography. Therefore, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis may produce retinal alterations with drusen or retinal pigment epithelium detachment, and requires an appropriate differential diagnosis to be made with age-related macular degeneration. The follow-up of these patients is important in order to detect vision-threatening complications.",0,1050
1579,"Hypertrigliceridemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis. The risk of developing acute pancreatitis is 5% in healthy patients and 4% during pregnancy with triglyceride levels >1,000mg/dl. During pregnancy there are changes in the lipid profile that increase between two and four times triglyceride levels. Its increase in excessive form produces an oxidative environment with injury of the endothelium and appearance of complications such as preeclampsia or pancreatitis. We present the case of a pregnant woman with pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia.",0,581
1580,"Retronychia is a recently described disorder caused by ingrowth of the proximal nail plate into the proximal nail fold. This situation provokes chronic paronychia refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Ultrasound has been proposed as the noninvasive method of choice to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differential diagnoses, particularly local tumors and arthritic disease. The presence of 2 or more overlapping nail plates and a reduced distance between the root of the nail plate and the base of the distal phalanx could be the ultrasound hallmarks of this condition. Nail plate avulsion is the treatment of choice and is curative. Knowledge of retronychia is still limited among dermatologists, which can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic errors and delay. This has prompted us to present this new case.",0,815
1581,"We here report a clinical case of a female patient presenting with a three-month history of a white onychodystrophic lesion of both hallux. The infection was due to a mold, identified as Curvularia lunata var aeria. The Curvularia gender is related to the production of phaeohyphomycosis, Curvularia lunata cause onychomycosis occasionally. The patient was treated with itraconazole 200mg/day, during six month with complete remission of the lesions. In conclusion, it is important to consider these fungi as causative agent of nail mycosis since the initial site of infection may be a pathway for systemic dissemination in inmunocompromised patients.",0,651
1582,"Donation after circulatory death (Maastricht type III donation) or controlled cardiac death refers to the retrieval of organs for transplantation purposes following death confirmed using circulatory criteria after the withdrawal of life support. The persistent shortfall in organ availability has prompted the development of donation programs following circulatory death for lung transplantation. The combined thorax-abdomen extraction in these cases is carried out in only twelve centres in Spain, while the combined use of abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) is even more exceptional. The first case of pulmonary and abdominal extraction in a Maastricht type III donor in Navarre with this type of preservation techniques is a milestone and the success achieved shows that it is a feasible and safe procedure.",0,823
1583,"Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is a complex combination of cardiovascular abnormalities defined as pulmonary hypertension with investment or bidirectional flow through an intracardiac or aortopulmonary communication, usually secondary to a congenital heart disease not resolved promptly. It carries a significant risk of perioperative mortality, with an incidence close to 30% for non-cardiac surgery. We report the anaesthetic management in a ES patient undergoing breast surgery, which was successfully performed under general anaesthesia combined with thoracic analgesic blocks. The main pathophysiological implications of this syndrome are discussed, emphasizing the importance of appropriate preoperative evaluation with thorough assessment of associated risks, careful intraoperative management, and postoperative care, which should be initially performed in a critical care unit. The need to individualize and tailor the choice of drugs and anesthetic technique to the hemodynamic condition of the patient and the surgical procedure is highlighted.",0,1050
1584,"Transversus abdominal plane (TAP) block is a known and useful technique, widely used for postoperative pain management of abdominal wall incisions. During the past years, and following the expansion of ultrasound guided techniques, its use has even gained more adepts. It is usually used as an adjuvant technique, primarily in order to control postoperative pain and reduce opioids consumption. We report the case of an 82 years old patient admitted for drainage of a postoperative abdominal wall hematoma after correction of a McBurney incisional hernia. The corrective surgery had gone on without incident, under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask. Two weeks later, the patient came back to our emergency department with a clear hematoma of the abdominal wall. Surgery was decided. A sole local anesthetic technique was achieved, using a TAP block. The block was performed under ultrasound guidance, using a subcostal approach. The surgery went on without complications. Therefore, TAP block offers a hemodynamic stability, appropriate intra-operative anesthesia and post-surgical analgesia of the abdominal wall.",0,1119

It predominantly affects older men and has distinctive histopathologic features as storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with immunostaining for IgG4, and it may be associated with elevated serum levels of IgG4. Although any organ can be affected, pituitary gland is rarely involved. We describe the case of a 36-year-old man who presented with headaches, impaired vision, panhypopituitarism with diabetes insipidus and an infiltrative lesion mainly of infundibulum and pituitary. We arrived at diagnosis of IgG4-RD by pituitary biopsy. A successful response to treatment with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids was achieved.",0,764

1587,"OBJETIVE: We report a case of acquired renal cystic disease associated with renal dialysis and endstage renal disease. The patient suffered the two major complications related with acquired renal cystic disease; hemorrhage and renal carcinoma. METHODS: Our case is a patient with acquired renal cystic disease, single kidney after surgery for renal clear cell carcinoma four years earlier, who developed a Wunderlich syndrome (WS). RESULTS: The histological study of the nephrectomy specimen showed a renal papillary carcinoma in the context of acquired renal cystic disease after surgery for a WS. CONCLUSIONS: Renal hemorrhage is a serious complication that can lead to a fatal outcome. Patients undergoing dialysis should be monitored actively due to the risk of developing acquired renal cystic disease and associated complications.",0,836
1588,"BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic surgery has increased recently due to successful results, achieved in several procedures. The aim of the present work is to present the first case in which single incision laparoscopy is used for the drainage of an amoebic liver abscess. CLINICAL CASE: A 44-year-old man presented with intense right upper quadrant pain, generalised jaundice, tachycardia, fever, hepatomegaly and a positive Murphy's sign. Laboratory results revealed an increased plasma bilirubin, elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminases, leucocytosis, negative viral panel for hepatitis, and positive antibodies against Entamoeba histolytica. On an abdominal computed tomography a 15 x 12.1 cm hypodense lesion was observed in the patient's liver, identified as an amoebic liver abscess. Analgesics and antibiotics were started and subsequently the patient was submitted to laparoscopic drainage of the abscess using a single port approach. Drainage and irrigation of the abscess was performed. Four days later the patient was discharged without complications. CONCLUSION: Management of amoebic liver abscess is focused on the elimination of the infectious agent and obliteration of the abscess cavity in order to prevent its complications, especially rupture. Laparoscopic surgery has proved to be a safe and effective way to manage this entity.",0,1363
1589,"OBJECTIVES: Spontaneous hemothorax is an uncommon event that can occur in patients with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 because of intrathoracic vascular malformations that predispose to aneurysms or bleeding from thoracic tumors. Only 53 cases of this rare association have been reported in the literature since 1975. We described 2 cases: one patient was a 73-year-old man with a right hemothorax secondary to an intercostal neurofibroma; the other was a 35-year-old woman with a left hemothorax secondary to a neurofibroma that compromised the internal mammary artery. Our review of the literature found that 61.8% of cases involved women with a mean age of 43.9 years. There was a certain tendency toward left-sided (56.4%) hemothorax, and the intercostal space was the most common site of bleeding. Treatment was most often surgical (58.2%) in reported cases, although selective artery embolization is also a valid choice. Exitus occurred during 30.9% of the reported episodes, and survival was higher in patients who were treated with surgery or arterial embolization than in those in whom only a thoracic drain was placed or who received no invasive treatment (P=.02).",0,1181
1590,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and progressive disease that can be inherited as autosomal dominant form. The BMPR2, ACVRL1 and ENG genes are main genes involved in the pathology. PAH associated to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another rare disease with a low incidence, prevalence and survival. The main objective of this analysis was to study the clinical and molecular characteristics of PAH associated to HIV patients. PATIENTS: We present 4 cases of HIV patients who developed PAH and have been treated with ambrisentan. RESULTS: Pathogenic mutations have been identify in analyzed genes in 3 of the four analyzed patients. In addition, these patients present other changes classified as benign after a thorough in silico analysis. We identified some changes in genetic modifiers that predispose to these patients to more severe phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical analysis can help to define monitoring for these patients and the administration of appropriate treatment. These patients also have shown several pathogenic mutations.",0,1088
1591,"Sjogren-Larsson syndrome is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic diplegia or quadriplegia. The primary defect in this syndrome is mutation of ALDH3A2 gen that codes for the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase. Deficiency of this enzyme causes an accumulation of fatty alcohols and fatty aldehydes, leading to altered cell-membrane integrity. Skin, eyes, and the central nervous system are affected latter. The diagnosis is carried out through the cuantification of the enzyme activity. This case report describes the diagnosis of a clinical syndrome with symptoms of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome by the quantification of the enzymatic activity in a culture of fibroblasts. Also, taking into account the genealogy of the patient, the study was conducted in the parents and a brother with signs suggestive of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.",0,855
1592,"INTRODUCTION: In the last years, new technologies such as the brain-machine interfaces (BMI) have been incorporated in the rehabilitation process of subjects with stroke. These systems are able to detect motion intention, analyzing the cortical signals using different techniques such as the electroencephalography (EEG). This information could guide different interfaces such as robotic devices, electrical stimulation or virtual reality. CASE REPORT: A 40 years-old man with stroke with two months from the injury participated in this study. We used a BMI based on EEG. The subject's motion intention was analyzed calculating the event-related desynchronization. The upper limb motor function was evaluated with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and the participant's satisfaction was evaluated using the QUEST 2.0. The intervention using a physical therapist as an interface was carried out without difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: The BMI systems detect cortical changes in a subacute stroke subject. These changes are coherent with the evolution observed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment.",0,1076
1593,"Wandering spleen syndrome is a rare condition in which absence or laxity of splenic fixing elements predisposes to an unusual location in the abdomen and an increasing risk of twisting and infarction. Its etiology may be congenital or acquired and clinical presentation is variable. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, laboratory and imaging. Surgery is the only definitive treatment for this pathology. We report the case of a 23 year old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant since childhood. On physical examination she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with marked abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant. Ultrasonography showed homogeneous splenomegaly. Abdominal CT-scan presented an enlarged, eutopic spleen, with swirling and congestion of hilum vessels. Splenic ischemia due to organ torsion was suspected. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed showing an 18 cm in diameter spleen free in left upper quadrant, with varicose veins in the periphery and without fixing ligaments. Laparoscopic splenectomy was completed. The pathology report showed ischemic necrosis of the organ. The patient progressed favorably and was discharged on the third postoperative day.",0,1237
1594,"OBJECTIVE: The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasia with intermediate biological potential, infrequent, with an unpredictable clinical prognosis and a low recurrence rate after an effective treatment. We report two cases of IMT with genitourinary localization, being this entit's publications infrequent. Both presented with little symptomatology, leading to multiple differential diagnosis. The surgical treatment was chosen and pathologic result confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This entity must be considered as a true malignant neoplasm with aggressive local behavior. The gold standard management is complete surgical resection, with low recurrence rate after it. A new oncological monitoring scheme is proposed, upon the lack of an active surveillance algorithm after treatment.",0,807
1595,"A 12 year-old boy who consulted due to nystagmus and low vision from birth. His mother also consulted for low vision of the right eye since she was a child, which worsened recently. The physical examination revealed no alterations in skin and hair pigmentation. In the examination of the anterior segment of the child, areas of slight circumferential hypopigmentation were observed in the iris in both eyes. The fundus examination revealed a choroidal fundus due to the absence of melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium. In the autofluorescence, an absence of physiological macular hypo-autofluorescence was observed and, in optical coherence tomography, foveal hypoplasia was observed in both eyes. In the ocular fundus examination of the mother, slight macular pigmentary changes were observed in the right eye, with hyperpigmented radiated spots in the retinal periphery of both eyes, which were hypo-autofluorescent in the wide-field autofluorescence. In the optical coherence tomography of the right eye, a cavitation of the outer retinal layers was observed in the fovea. The genetic study by nucleotide sequencing was performed on the mother and the child. In the mutation found in the GPR143 gene, the son was hemizygous and the mother was heterozygous. X-linked ocular albinism was diagnosed and the genetic counselling was carried out. Ocular albinism linked to X is the most frequent genetic variant of this disease. Peripheral pigment alterations in heterozygous mothers have been previously described in the literature, but there are no reports of cavitations in the external retinal layers using optical coherence tomography.",0,1642

1599,"INTRODUCTION: The response of the thalamus during the study with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) is not sufficiently understood. CASE REPORT: A 17-year-old man undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation in the centromedian nucleus for drug-resistant epilepsy under complete sedation. During the intervention, the responses to SSEPs of the thalamic nuclei were recorded by means of four microelectrodes. These responses can be decomposed into three types: local field potentials (LFP), low amplitude fast oscillations (LFO), and high amplitude slow oscillations (HSO). LFO are widespread in much of the registered regions. However, HSOs are located at a single point in the registry and are closely associated with LFPs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence of LFO has been considered as an indicator of the presence of the sensory thalamus, its wide extension by different thalamic nuclei suggests that it is an unspecific response to SSEPs. However, the restricted spatial location of HSO and their association with LFP suggest that these newly described potentials are the markers for the presence of the sensory thalamus. Their identification may prove very useful in thalamic deep brain stimulation either in awake patients or especially in those requiring sedation.",0,1278
1600,"Hydatid disease is an accidental parasitosis, with brain location being rare. The case is reported of a 33year-old male, with no history of note, who was admitted to hospital with intracranial hypertension syndrome and right hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a cystic lesion in the left frontal-parietal lobule. Surgery was performed by complete excision of the lesion, with a good outcome.

1601,"OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary nocardiosis is an uncommon pulmonary infection caused by aerobic gram-positive bacteria of the genus Nocardia. Nocardia sp. are environmental organisms spread worldwide. Approximately 50 Nocardia species have been described to date, about 30 of which are known to cause human disease. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was first reported in 2001. CASE REPORT: We report a case of infection caused by N. cyriacigeorgica in a patient with B-cells non-Hodgkin lymphoma and diabetes mellitus. The microbiological findings reflect a possible co-infection by N. cyriacigeorgica and Aspergillus fumigatus. CONCLUSIONS: Patient's background and information related to risk factors are essential to detect the growth of Nocardia sp. in the laboratory. Furthermore, diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is particularly controversial, especially in intensive care units patients. Taking everything into account, we will discuss a possible co-infection by N. cyriacigeorgica and A. fumigatus in a critically ill patient.",0,1029
1602,"The case of a 22 year-old pregnant woman, suffering an infectious disease with skin lesions on the head, is presented. The patient referred a systemic mycosis 5 years before, treated with oral antifungal, with good clinical response. The mycological study of the skin clinical samples showed multiple budding yeast like elements consistent with Paracoccidioides, and the same organism was isolated in cultures. Physical examination and images studies did not show other location of the mycosis. The patient was treated with oral cotrimoxazole during pregnancy and lactation; afterwards this treatment was stopped and replaced by itraconazole by oral route at a daily dose of 200mg due to the poor clinical response observed with the first treatment. A rapid and favorable evolution was seen with the latter.",0,807
1603,"Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are central nervous system (CNS) depressants which are widely used to treat insomnia and anxiety, despite having long-term adverse side effects. (Fortea Gonzalez, Oriolo, Balcells Olivero, Sanchez Del Valle &amp; Castellvi, 2017). As with alcohol, continued use can lead to tolerance and dependence phenomena.

1604,"Calcaneus osteomyelitis is a rare infection in newborns. Invasive procedures, prematurity and low birth wight are some causative factors. The clinical signs may be mild. We report a neonate with calcaneous osteomyelitis which was secondary to a Guthrie test sample. She was admitted to hospital with swelling, redness and increased temperature on her heel. Superficial tissue ultrasound showed fluid collection with heavy content was observed on the posterior of the right foot. Puncture and drainage was performed and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the drainage culture. Extremity magnetic resonance imaging showed tissue defect in right foot, edema-inflammation and contrast enhancement. Intravenous sulbactam-ampicillin and oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were given for 6 weeks. In follow-up, clinical symptoms recovered without curettage. In conclusion; calcaneous osteomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of swelling on heel in neonates who have been applied to invasive procedures as Guthrie test sample.",0,1073
1605,"Transverse vaginal septum is a disorder that would arise from a failure in the fusion and/or channeling of the urogenital sinus and the mullerian ducts with low frequency but with a significant impact on the health of patients. The treatment is surgical and it will depend on the location and thickness of the septum. Sometimes, it described a female sex-limited autosomal recessive transmission but few cases of family association have been reported.

1606,"BACKGROUND: Ectopic gastric mucosa has been described in different locations of the digestive tract, but that of the rectum is the least frequent. CLINICAL CASE: The case is described of a 48 year-old woman being investigated by the gastrointestinal department due to rectal bleeding and rectal tenesmus. Colonoscopy showed a diverticular cavity 3 cm, which was reported by histology as fundic-type heterotopic gastric mucosa. Barium enema and abdominopelvic CT showed a diverticular image at level of the right posterolateral wall of the rectal ampulla. Trans-rectal diverticulectomy was performed with primary closure of the resulting mucosal defect. The surgical specimen showed areas of gastric epithelium with no signs of atypia. CONCLUSIONS: It is not known whether the origin of heterotopic gastric mucosa occurs during foetal development or is the result of abnormal regeneration under inflammatory conditions. It is usually clinically asymptomatic or presents as haematochezia, especially in cases where gastric acid is being produced. In these cases there must be an initial treatment with proton pump inhibitors, although the definitive treatment is always surgical or endoscopic excision of the mucosa.",0,1214

Hay muy pocos casos descritos en varones. El sintoma caracteristico es el dolor abdominal en el cuadrante superior derecho, que hace que se confunda el cuadro con una enfermedad de la via biliar. Son caracteristicas las adherencias fuertes entre el diafragma y el higado en forma de <<cuerda de violin>>. Presentamos el caso de un varon de 81 anos que se somete a una colecistectomia laparoscopica por pancreatitis de repeticion. Durante la cirugia se encuentran las caracteristicas adherencias en <<cuerda de violin>>, que se seccionan. El paciente da positivo para anticuerpos contra Chlamydia trachomatis. Hay nueve casos descritos en la literatura de FHCS en varones. Este sindrome se confunde muchas veces con patologia infecciosa biliar, lo que nos obliga a someter al paciente a una cirugia para realizar el diagnostico cuando se encuentran las caracteristicas adherencias. Si sospechamos la enfermedad mediante las pruebas complementarias, podemos intentar tratarla con antibioticos. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is the inflammation of the hepatic capsule without affecting the parenchyma, which is associated with a pelvic inflammatory disease. There have been very few cases in men. The main symptom is abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, which can be confused with a bile duct disorder. Strong violin string-like adhesions between the diaphragm and the liver are characteristic. In the study concerned, it is reported the case of an 81 year-old man who undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for recurrent pancreatitis. During surgery, the typical violin string-like adhesions are found and sectioned. The patient tests positive for Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies. Only nine cases in men have been reported in FHCS literature. This syndrome is frequently confused with infectious biliary tract disease, so the patient should undergo a surgery to diagnose when the characteristic adhesions are found. If the disease is suspected by the additional tests, it can be treated with antibiotics.",0,2173
1609,"CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old woman presented with a salmon-coloured patch of 0.7mm diameter in the right eye that extended into the lower fornix in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva, with irregular edges, and highly vascularised. Incisional biopsy was performed, showing it to be a low-grade conjunctival non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma (or a mucosa associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma). DISCUSSION: The lesion remained stable for 24 months of follow-up, when a relapse of the condition occurred, producing an enlargement of the initial lesion. The definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy of the affected tissue and histopathologic study.",0,638
1610,"CASE REPORT: A 20 year-old woman presented with an asymmetric bilateral keratoconus. Cross-linking of the right eye was performed due of its topographic and pachymetric conditions. Three days after the procedure, the patient presented with some corneal infiltrates that where classified as sterile. DISCUSSION: Cross-linking is known for its efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, there can be complications. Sterile infiltrates have already been described, although their aetiology is still not clear.",0,498
1611,"Kennedy's disease, also known as bulbospinal muscular atrophy, is a rare, X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder affecting adult males. It is caused by expansion of an unstable cytosine-adenine-guanine tandem-repeat in exon 1 of the androgen-receptor gene on chromosome Xq11-12, and is characterized by spinal motor neuron progressive degeneration. Endocrinologically, these patients often have the features of hypogonadism associated to the androgen insensitivity syndrome, particularly its partial forms. We report 4 cases with the typical neurological presentation, consisting of slowly progressing generalized muscle weakness with atrophy and bulbar muscle involvement; these patients also had several endocrine manifestations; the most common non-neurological manifestation was gynecomastia. In all cases reported, molecular analysis showed an abnormal cytosine-adenine-guanine triplet repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene.",0,945
1612,"Neurological manifestations associated with influenza virus infection include encephalitis, encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalitis, transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, mild encephalitis with reversible splenial syndrome (MERS), and Guillain Barre syndrome. We report a 16-year-old female who was admitted at our emergency department with seizures, confusion, nystagmus and motor clumsiness five days after an upper a respiratory tract infection. Influenza type B virus infection was confirmed by chain polymerase reaction analysis. The initial electroencephalogram demonstrated a pattern of global slowness without epileptic discharges. One week later, it showed a progression to slow-wave focal bilateral discharges at both temporal and occipital lobes. The patient had a favorable evolution and was discharged 19 days after admission with phenytoin to prevent seizures.",0,902
1613,"Laryngotracheal surgery has an inherent risk of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN). These complications go from minor dysphonia to even bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The intraoperative neuromonitoring of the RLN was developed in the field of thyroid surgery, in order to preserve nerve and vocal cord function. However, tracheal surgery requires in-field intubation of the distal trachea, which limits the use of nerve monitoring using conventional endotracheal tube with surface electrodes. Given these challenges, we present an alternative method for nerve monitoring during laryngotracheal surgery through the insertion of electrodes within the endolaryngeal musculature by bilateral puncture.",0,710
1614,"Anaphylaxis is a serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and can cause death. Premature newborns, whose immunological system is immature, are less likely to develop anaphylaxis. Administration of amikacin, containing sodium metabisulfite, to a 3-day-old premature newborn, induced a near fatal anaphylaxis. After suspicion of sepsis, the baby was started on amikacin. Clinical improvement was observed after initiation of treatment. On the third day of treatment with amikacin, the newborn suddenly developed tachypnea, tachycardia, angioedema and cyanosis. Anaphylaxis was diagnosed and treated. Latent reaction occurred after one hour of clinical improvement. The baby was intubated immediately. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency; therefore the clinicians should have a rapid and careful assessment about this potentially fatal reaction. Even after successful treatment of anaphylaxis, the patient should be under observation for 72 hours because of the possibility of a biphasic reaction.",0,1018
1615,"A 38-year-old female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia for several months following immunodepleting autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. She was treated for influenza, which was isolated repeatedly from oropharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and later empirically for lupus pneumonitis, but died 6 months after transplant. Autopsy findings failed to show influenza in the lungs or lupus pneumonitis. A novel generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using degenerate primers identified human coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 RNA in BAL fluid at autopsy. CoV was confirmed by virus-specific PCRs of lung tissue at autopsy. Electron microscopy showed viral particles consistent with CoV HKU1 in lung tissue both at autopsy and from a previous biopsy. Although human CoV HKU1 infection is not usually severe, in highly immunocompromised patients, it can be associated with fatal pneumonia.",1,973
1616,"Lipoma is a tumor of adipose tissue cells that can develop in any part of the body; We present the case of an 86-year-old woman with a lesion of the left thigh as well as her diagnostic approach, specific surgical treatment and histopathological analysis. Three years after its resection, the function of the lower extremity was preserved.",0,339
1617,"Osteoblastoma is an infrequent primary osseous tumour. Its presentation in the upper extremities and more specifically in the carpal bones is unusual. We present a case of osteoblastoma localized in the hamate bone and review the treatment realized in this infrequent localization. A young male patient with pain and swelling in the back of his hand of one year's evolution, resistant to medical treatment. Complementary tests showed lytic tumefaction in the hamate bone with non-aggressive characteristics. It was treated by curettage and filling the iliac crest with autologous graft. The pathological anatomical study diagnosed that it was a case of osteoblastoma. The result was satisfactory, with total disappearance of the pain and a radiological image of complete restitution of the osseous defect, with no signs of recurrence after 4 years. The treatment should be curettage plus autologous graft. Conversely, resection of the affected bone can be considered in cases with aggressive data.",0,997
1618,"Pancreatitis consists in acute inflammation of the pancreas that is clinically characterized by abdominal pain. To make the diagnosis it is necessary the elevation of biochemical markers like pancreatic amylase or lipase. It is the most frequent pancreatic disease in both children and adults. Its presentation in the pediatric population is increasing and has several etiologies such as: infections, trauma, intoxication and metabolic diseases. Trauma mechanisms have been described: child maltreatment, falls, trauma with the bicycle handle and traffic accidents. In this article, we present a case of pancreatitis secondary to an abdominal trauma with the handle of a bicycle in a patient of 7 years.",0,703
1619,"Escherichia vulneris is a gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae, with a questioned pathogenic role. However, it has been confirmed as the cause of wound infections. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl, previously healthy, with a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the right knee, secondary to a spinal lesion. Escherichia vulneris, an unusual etiology of septic arthritis in children, was isolated in the joint fluid. This case is one of the first cases of septic arthritis due to E. vulneris, secondary to a plant-derived foreign body in a child, described in the medical literature. The importance of performing the microbiological study of joint fluid in patients with septic arthritis caused by a foreign body of plant-derived origin is emphasized.",0,786
1620,"BACKGROUND: Partial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice for T1a tumours. The open approach is still the standard method. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery offers advantages that are applicable to partial nephrectomy, such as the use of the Firefly(R) system with near-infrared fluorescence. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the implementation of fluorescence in nephron-sparing surgery. CASE REPORT: This case concerned a 37-year-old female smoker, with obesity. The patient had a right kidney tumour measuring 31 mm, which was found using tomography. She therefore underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, with a warm ischaemia time of 22 minutes and the use of fluorescence with the Firefly(R) system to guide the resection. There were no complications. The tumour was a pT1aN0M0 renal cell carcinoma, with negative margins. Robot-assisted renal laparoscopic surgery is employed for nephron-sparing surgery, with good oncological and functional results. The combination of the Firefly(R) technology and intraoperative ultrasound can more accurately delimit the extent of the lesion, increase the negative margins and decrease the ischaemia time. CONCLUSION: Near-infrared fluorescence in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy is useful for guiding the tumour resection and can potentially improve the oncological and functional results.",0,1351
1621,"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic gastrectomy has emerged in recent years as an effective technique for the treatment of morbid obesity due to low mortality morbidity rates. Its complications include dehiscence suture line, and others such as splenic infarction. We discuss a case of splenic infarction after laparoscopic gastrectomy. CLINICAL CASE: 45 year old male with a BMI of 37.8 kg/m(2), diabetes-II for 15 years, the last five in treatment with insulin, a fasting blood glucose around 140mg/dl, HbA1c of 7.3mg/dl and microangiopathy diabetic nephropathy. The patient underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and he was discharged from hospital 48hours later. 1 month later he presented at the hospital for epigastric pain and fever up to 40 degrees C. An intra abdominal abscess was detected and there was no leakage. The spleen was normal. He was treated with radiological drainage. 9 months later the patient consulted again due to epigastric pain in upper left quadrant, associated with low-grade fever. Thoraco-abdominal CT images compatible with splenic infarction. Currently patient remains asymptomatic one year after surgery. DISCUSSION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is one of the most popular procedures of bariatric surgery. Less common complications include abscess and the splenic infarction. Usually patients are asymptomatic, but sometimes cause fever and pain. Initial treatment should be conservative. Only in selected cases, would splenectomy be indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic infarction is usually an early complication, but we should keep it in mind as a long term complication for patients with persistent fever and abdominal pain after laparoscopic gastrectomy.",0,1690
1622,"The sudden change in vision is a medical emergency that must be evaluated immediately to rule out important institutions as systemic vasculitis or ischemic stroke. Its association with hypertensive crisis makes it necessary to rule out accelerated-malignant hypertension, which is accompanied by other retinal disorders (exudates and hemorrhages) and adrenal involvement. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is another entity to consider, as is it not uncommon in the young (12.7% in a series of 848 cases). Its association with hypertension has been described in 32% of cases.",0,596
1623,"Septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is an uncommon condition, caused by hematic bacterial migration or direct migration of other head and neck infections. We report a 41 year old female who presented a right temporomandibular joint involvement, with bone destruction of the mandibular condyle and an infectious process spreading to the temporal space, following a necrotizing medial and external otitis with associated mastoiditis. A septic arthritis of the TMJ by continuity was diagnosed and treated with antimicrobials, TMJ arthrocentesis and occlusal stabilization, with a positive evolution. However, the patient remains in control due a secondary TMJ osteoarthritis caused by the septic arthritis.",0,721
1624,"A 55-year-old female patient, born in Ayacucho, with a history of dermatomyositis for 3 years, who received irregular treatment with prednisone. Two months prior to admission, she presented with autoinmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The patient received methylprednisolone pulse therapy and packed red blood cells transfusions. Upon admission, she was drowsy, with a poor overall status, marked weight loss, dehydration, with presence of livedo reticularis in her lower extremities, and onychodystrophy and onycholysis on the toes of both feet. Western blot test was positive for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The patient evolved with recurrent hypoglycemia. Therefore, we report a case of dermatomyositis and Evans syndrome in the context of an HTLV-1 infection.",0,808
1625,"Penicilliosis is an opportunistic infection in HIV-infected and other immunocompromised patients mostly in Southeast Asia, Southern China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with respiratory manifestations in about one-third of patients.

1626,"INTRODUCTION: Pompe disease is a generalized progressive disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosome enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). We present three cases with different clinical symptomatology and treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with positive evolution. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: three-month old male, with weakness and rejecting meals; mild hepatomegaly, discrete macroglossia and muscular hypotony; and increased muscular enzymes. Case 2: five-month old male, with delayed motor development, severe neurosensory deafness, and respiratory disorder of difficult evolution; muscular hypotony; and mild increase in creatine kinase. Case 3: 22-year old male, with progressive dyspnea, with history of increased creatine kinase and transaminases, and hypercholesterolemia. He suffered from severe respiratory failure requiring endotraqueal intubation Muscular biopsy showed glycogen storage suggestive of Pompe disease. In the three cases, the EMG showed a characteristic pattern with pseudomyotonic discharges and the deficiency in GAA was confirmed in lymphocytes. One single mutation was observed in one case and two in the other two cases. Every patient received ERT showing a favorable evolution; with disappearance of cardiac disorders in case 1, improvement in motor development in both infants and no longer need for mechanical ventilation in case 3. CONCLUSION: Pompe disease has a wide variability in clinical expression. ERT achieves a good response, especially in infant forms of the disease. The survival of treated patients with these Pompe disease forms will allow knowing further the course of the disease.",0,1638
1627,"Multiple myeloma is a hematologic disease, which accounts for 15% of hematologic malignancies. The average age of onset is between 65-70 years and is very rare in young patients, as 2% are under 40 years old. We present a case of 36-year-old women with history of 20 pack years (p/y) smoking, who complaints of dyspnea associated with signs of right cardiac overload, anemia, proteinuria, elevated acute phase reactants and spirometry pattern suggestive of moderately-severe restriction and severe drop in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Echocardiogram evidence dilated right heart cavities and signs of pulmonary hypertension which is confirmed by right heart catheterization. In search of the etiology we arrive to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.",0,766
1628,"Invasive fungal infections are a considerable cause of morbidity, mortality, increased hospital stay durations, and high health care costs, during neonatal period. In this period, the premature infants are the most affected. Candida species are the leading cause of invasive fungal infections. The majority of neonatal Candida infections are caused by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, although other fungus species are being reported. One such emerging pathogen is K. ohmeri. This organism has been reported as a pathogen in the neonatal period, principally in premature infants. The risk factors associated with fungal infection are central line, immunosuppression, prolonged hospital stay, endotracheal intubation and exposure to antibiotics. We present a term baby with a mediastinal mass, who required several procedures, as pericardiocentesis, central catheters, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics. During his evolution, he presented infection by K. ohmeri. The baby was treated with amphotericin B, with satisfactory clinical course.",0,1068
1629,"We report the case of a 32-year-old patient complaining of chronic low back pain radiating to his left thigh. His MRI showed a lytic L1 vertebral body injury. A transpedicular biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell tumor. He underwent a L1 vertebrectomy and vertebral body replacement with a titanium cylinder using anterior approach, followed by the removal of the L1 posterior arch and the placement of pedicle screws through a posterior approach. The giant cell tumor is a rare benign primary bone tumor that can be locally aggressive and can potentially spread to other areas, usually to the lungs. Although it most frequently affects long bones, approximately 10% of tumors are located in the spine. To minimise the risk of recurrence, the elective management option is surgery.",0,789
1630,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of orbital mass and proptosis, diagnosed as Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). METHODS: Clinical case report based on the review of clinical charts, radiological images, and histopathology. RESULTS: A 42-year-old male with orbital mass and proptosis of the right eye. A surgical biopsy was performed, and the diagnosis of RDD was established using microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Definitive management included open tumour cytoreduction, with good response. DISCUSSION: The RDD is a rare, benign, proliferative condition of unknown origin. It rarely affects the cranial cavities, with the orbital presentation being very unusual. Diagnostic confirmation is essential for the best surgical management.",0,727
1631,"Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide clinical spectrum of disease. It is characterized by development of benign tumors in multiple organs due to a disturbance in cellular growth and differentiation. It usually affects skin, brain, heart and kidney. Gastrointestinal involvement is rare and mainly restricted to adults and sigmoid colon and rectum. In children there are only two cases; our patient would be the third. We present a patient with tuberous sclerosis who began at the first month of life with repeated intestinal subocclusion. The videocolonoscopy showed a mass protruding into the lumen of the ascending colon. Right hemicolectomy was performed. The anatomopathological report corresponded to a hamartomatous polyp. The clinical and nutritional evolution in the postoperative period was very favorable. Although uncommon, the hamartomatous polyp should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal occlusion in pediatrics.",0,976
1632,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration is one of the most mutilating surgical procedures with high post-operative morbidity. The laparoscopic technique aims to reduce perioperative complications and reduce post-surgical recovery. OBJECTIVE: We present the first case of laparoscopic anterior exenteration for locally advanced melanoma, held at the National Cancer Institute and published in Mexico. CASE REPORT: Patient 60 years of age diagnosed with invasive vulvar melanoma with bladder extension upon whom laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration with external urinary reconstruction was performed. Time in surgery was 505minutes and estimated blood loss was 400ml. No complications occurred during or immediately after surgery. The final histopathological study reported: nodular lesion that completely replaces the clitoris and spreads to the left labia majora, measures 3x2.5x2cm and is located relative to the free margins with perineural invasion intraepithelial spread in space and urethra and bladder trigone. CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration is a safe alternative in well-selected patients, with acceptable time in surgery, surgical complications and recovery time.",0,1196
1633,"The main adverse effects of dopaminergic drugs used in Parkinson's disease are hypotension, somnolence, hallucinations and impulse control disorder. Less common is leg edema. We report on a 68-year-old male receiving levodopa and pramipexole consulting for severe leg edema lasting two years, whose etiology was not ascertained with multiple lab tests. This edema subsided substantially when pramipexole was discontinued and the dose of levodopa was increased to treat motor symptoms.",0,484
1634,"BACKGROUND: The principles of perineal reconstructive surgery comprise adequate filling of the defect along with stable and durable skin coverage, with a low morbidity rate. Two-flap perineal reconstruction is a simple, fast and reliable technique that uses a single donor site. This improves scar position with low morbidity. It is based in the use of 2flaps; one flap fills the defect with a <<turn over>> technique and the other is a rotation - advancement flap for skin coverage. CLINICAL CASE: A 52-year-old male diagnosed with Lynch syndrome who underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal amputation for adenocarcinoma of the lower rectum and developed recurrence 2years later over the perineal scar that required radical resection and perineal reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The use of this approach facilitates perineal reconstruction and enables treatment of patients with large and complex defects in frequently irradiated tissues where wound dehiscence and infection are common.",0,983
1635,"INTRODUCTION: Congenital surfactant deficiency is a condition infrequently diagnosed in newborns. A clinical case is presented of surfactant protein B deficiency. A review is performed on the study, treatment and differential diagnosis of surfactant protein deficiencies and infant chronic interstitial lung disease. CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a term newborn that developed respiratory distress, recurrent pulmonary opacification, and a transient response to the administration of surfactant. Immunohistochemical and genetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of surfactant protein B deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary congenital anomalies require a high index of suspicion. Surfactant protein B deficiency is clinically progressive and fatal in the majority of the cases, similar to that of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) deficiency. Protein C deficiency is insidious and may present with a radiological pulmonary interstitial pattern. Due to the similarity in the histological pattern, genetic studies help to achieve greater certainty in the prognosis and the possibility of providing adequate genetic counselling.",0,1144
1636,"Ten years have elapsed since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, which resulted in more than 8000 cases worldwide with more than 700 deaths. Recently, a new coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus emerged, causing serious respiratory cases and death. By the end of August 2013, 108 cases including 50 deaths were reported. The authors discuss a coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was detected in Hungary in 2005 and highlight its significance in 2013. In 2005 the patient was hospitalized and all relevant clinical and microbiological tests were performed. Based on the IgG antibody positivity of the serum samples, the patient was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the past. The time and source of the infection remained unknown. The condition of the patient improved and he was discharged from the hospital. The case raises the possibility of infections in Hungary imported from remote areas of the world and the importance of thorough examination of patients with severe respiratory syndrome with unknown etiology.",1,1125
1637,"Cerebral oximetry based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is used to determine cerebral tissue oxygenation. We hereby present the clinical case of a 12-month old child with right hemiparesis secondary to prior left middle cerebral artery stroke 8 months ago. The child underwent surgical enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with cardiopulmonary bypass. During cardiopulmonary bypass, asymmetric NIRS results were detected between both hemispheres. The utilization of multimodal neuromonitoring (NIRS-BIS) allowed acting on both perfusion pressure and anesthetic depth to balance out the supply and demand of cerebral oxygen consumption. No new neurological sequelae were observed postoperatively. We consider bilateral NIRS monitoring necessary in order to detect asymmetries between cerebral hemispheres. Although asymmetries were not present at baseline, they can arise intraoperatively and its monitoring thus allows the detection and treatment of cerebral ischemia-hypoxia in the healthy hemisphere, which if undetected and untreated would lead to additional neurological damage.",0,1119
1638,"Mouth ulcers are a cutaneous complication that can often affect kidney transplant patients, mostly due to the effect of immunosuppressive treatment. Even so, before asserting that said complication is indeed secondary to drugs, it is very important to establish a differential diagnosis with other mouth ulcer causes, such as systemic diseases or viral infections, which are also common in these patients.",0,405
1639,"Intestinal tuberculosis is less common than pulmonary tuberculosis. Its clinical and endoscopic features are nonspe-cific, so diagnostic suspicion must be high in order to make an early diagnosis and prevent iatrogenia. Pharmacotherapy is often effective, with an excellent clinical and endoscopic evolution. Surgical treatment is reserved for complications. We present the case of cecal tuberculosis diagnosed endoscopically; this is the second case diagnosed in a few months in our center. In this case there were no risk factors, such as recent travel, risk of contacts or inmunosupression.",0,593
1640,"UNLABELLED: Sotos Syndrome (SS) is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant pattern caused by haplo-insufficiency of NSD1 gene secondary to point mutations or microdeletion of the 5q35 locus where the gene is located. It is a rare syndrome, occurring in 7 out of every 100,000 births. The objective of this report is to present the case of a 4 year-old patient with a global developmental delay, as well as specific physical findings suggesting a syndrome of genetic origin. CLINICAL CASE: Female patient, 4 years of age, thinning hair, triangular facie, long palpebral fissure, arched palate, prominent jaw, winged scapula and clinodactilia of the fifth finger both hands. The molecular test comparative genomic hybridisation test by microarray was subsequently performed, with the result showing 5q35.2 q35.3 region microdeletion of 2,082 MB, including the NSD1 gene. CONCLUSION: Finally, this article also proposes the performing of comparative genomic hybridisation as the first diagnostic option in cases where clinical findings are suggestive of SS.",0,1059
1641,"We report a case of symptomatic subluxation of the semitendinosus and gracilis over the medial condyle of the tibia caused by the thickening of its tendons. Snapping was reproduced on active extension. Clinical examination and, above all, dynamic ultrasound were the key for the diagnosis because other imaging tests were normal. Due to failure of conservative treatment with physiotherapy and infiltrations, surgery was undertaken, involving desinsertion and excision of distal 8cm segment of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. At the present time (6 months postoperatively), the patient is symptom-free and has returned to the previous normal life activities.",0,667
1642,"BACKGROUND: Adnexal paraovarian cysts are not frequently seen during teen development, their incidence is around 10% and usually benign. CLINICAL CASE: Adolescent female 15 years old with no pathological family and personal history relevant to her current condition. Chief complaint: Six months ago she complained with abdominal pain in meso, hypogastrium and right iliac fossa. Later, she observed an increased volume on her lower quadrant of the abdomen, mostly on her right side. During physical examination an abdominal tumor was palpated. By an abdominal-rectal manouvre, the presence of tumor was confirmed and located in front of the rectum and no implants. Imaging studies confirmed a paraovarian cyst. She underwent on surgical laparatomy and a paraovarian cyst was found. The histological diagnosis was a cystadenoma. The postoperative course was satisfactory. DISCUSSION: Epidemiological data and ultrasonographic findings are examined to confirm the diagnosis of paraovarian cyst. The laparoscopic treatment for adnexal problems is described.",0,1054
1643,"INTRODUCTION: Femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome is a rare disease with variable expressivity, although cases have been reported with an autosomal dominant pattern. It particularly affects the structures of the face associated with hypoplasia of the femur. Its aetiology is relatively unknown. However, this syndrome has been associated with maternal diabetes, drug exposure, viral infections, radiation, and oligohydramnios. OBJECTIVE: The case of a newborn with this syndrome is presented. CLINICAL CASE: Newborn of 41 weeks gestation with small nose, thin upper lip, micrognathia, long philtrum, low set ears, epicanthal folds, dysplastic hips showing flexion, and adduction of the right leg, and shortening at the expense of the thigh. X-ray images revealed femoral hypoplasia and dysplastic acetabular roof. Different physicians from other specialties who excluded other associated malformations performed a complete evaluation. Surgical bone lengthening of lower limb is scheduled at 5 months of age, with the purpose that she walks with her own feet; at the same time she began management with kinesiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome is a rare condition. A multidisciplinary health care team must treat individuals with femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome.",0,1310
1644,"The association between vascular tumors and thrombocytopenia is rare. Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome is seen in childhood and is characterized by hemangiomas and thrombocytopenia. A 42 years-old man with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma and thrombocytopenia, admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage is reported. The patient was operated and required a splenectomy to manage the thrombocytopenia. After the splenectomy the patient developed a subdural hematoma that was operated. Despite the surgical treatment, the patient died.",0,520
1645,"CLINICAL CASE: A 33-year old woman presents with unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis, ipsilateral regional lymphadenopathy and fever. A Bartonella henselae infection is demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, and a diagnosis of a Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is established. Outcome after treatment with oral doxycycline is satisfactory. DISCUSSION: Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is the most frequent ocular manifestation of a Bartonella henselae infection.",0,477
1646,"Recurrent wheezing is a very common clinical ailment throughout infancy and childhood. The most common diagnosis in children with wheezing is asthma. However, some other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis such as a congenital cardiac defect. We present a case of a four year old boy presenting with recurrent wheezing who was referred to our institution for cardiac evaluation. Severe mitral stenosis secondary to an anomalous mitral arcade was diagnosed by physical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and mainly transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Anomalous mitral arcade is a rare congenital malformation of the mitral tensor apparatus which comprises the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles. This abnormal anatomy leads to increased filling pressure of the left ventricle, a retrograde post capillary pulmonary hypertension and interstitial aedema. The patient was referred to cardiac surgery and underwent a successful procedure with complete removal of the obstructive mitral lesion.",0,1040
1647,"BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a frequent condition in patients with a history of trauma. The major pathologic causes include vascular diseases, malignancies, hypercoagulability states, long-term steroid treatment, and some patients have a history of hepatitis C infection treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Upon studying the behavior of the hepatitis C virus, Seef, Foster and Poynard found a hypercoagulability state that causes interruption of retinacular blood flow to the femoral head, without an increased incidence of osteonecrosis in this patient group. Lauer states that such viral infections involve an autoimmune process and may result in transient vasculitides. Giampaolo, in 2005, reported the relationship between interferon use for multiple myeloma and other cancers and femoral avascular necrosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cases with a diagnosis of bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head were assessed. RESULTS: Five patients were included, 4 females and one male, with a diagnosis of bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head. All of them had history of hepatitis C infection treated with pegylated interferon. The final diagnosis was proven by pathology after arthroplasty. A literature review was made of articles on the relationship between this condition and interferon use in patients with hepatitis C infection. CONCLUSIONS: Finding out the relationship between viral diseases such as hepatitis B and C infection and hypercoagulability states, autoimmune processes leading to transient vasculitides and the use of pegylated interferon 2B, will help us discover new nontraumatic causes associated with this condition.",0,1680
1648,"INTRODUCTION: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease. It is due to a mutation in the ABCD1 gene. The loss of functioning of ABCD1 triggers ineffective beta oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, which gives rise to an accumulation of these fatty acids. The typical alteration revealed in neuroimaging scans in the cerebral form is symmetrical periventricular demyelination with posterior location. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 10-year-old boy with right spastic hemiparesis and subacute cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed symmetrical involvement of the white matter in the left frontoparietotemporal region, and calcifications were observed in the computerised axial tomography scan. X-ALD was confirmed by means of the elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids, and a pathogenic variant was found in the ABCD1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Symmetrical demyelination with calcifications has rarely been reported in X-ALD, and these findings could delay diagnosis. This exceptional presentation should always be taken into consideration in children with subacute onset of motor symptoms and cognitive or behavioural regression.",0,1205
1649,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of porphyria: it is characterized by blistering lesions, erosions and crusts on the back of the hands, associated with photosensitivity and facial hypertrichosis. It is produced by acquired or hereditary deficiency of the enzyme UROD, fifth enzyme in the chain of production of the Heme group. This causes accumulation of porphyrins in the liver, which are subsequently mobilized to the skin, where lesions are generated by photosensitivity. This deficiency can be exacerbated by multiple causes. We report a 51-year-old female presenting with the characteristic dermal lesions described above, which disappeared when she discontinued her hormone replacement therapy with estradiol and dydrogesterone. Urinary and blood uroporphyrin and hexacarboxyl porphyrins were elevated and plasma ferritin was 479 ng/ml. Hormone replacement therapy was discontinued and phlebotomies were attempted but not tolerated by the patient. The dermic lesions have not relapsed.",0,1012
1650,"CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old pseudophakic male with recurrent blurred vision episodes associated with uveitis, hyphema, glaucoma and vitreous hemorrhage. Iris transillumination defects and apposition of the optic and iris were found. The patient was diagnosed with Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema (UGH) Syndrome. DISCUSSION: Mechanical irritation of the iris is a consequence of intraocular lens malposition and causes UGH Syndrome. Occasionally it is associated with vitreous hemorrhage. Lens malposition is detected by optical coherence tomography and/or ultrasound biomicroscopy.",0,573
1651,"BACKGROUND: The complications of otitis media (intra-cranial and extra-cranial) used to have a high morbidity and mortality in the pre-antibiotic era, but these are now relatively rare, mainly due to the use of antibiotics and the use of ventilation tubes, reducing the incidence of such complications significantly. Currently, an early suspicion of these complications is a major challenge for diagnosis and management. CLINICAL CASES: The cases of 5 patients (all male) are presented, who were diagnosed with complicated otitis media, 80% (4) with a mean age of 34.6 years (17-52). There was major comorbidity in 60% (3), with one patient with diabetes mellitus type 2, and two with chronic renal failure. There were 3 (60%) intra-cranial complications: one patient with thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus and a cerebellar abscess; another with a retroauricular and brain abscess, and a third with meningitis. Of the 2 (40%) extra-cranial complications: one patient had a Bezold abscess, and the other with a soft tissue abscess and petrositis. All patients were managed with surgery and antibiotic therapy, with 100% survival (5), and with no neurological sequelae. The clinical course of otitis media is usually short, limiting the infection process in the majority of patients due to the immune response and sensitivity of the microbe to the antibiotic used. However, a small number of patients (1-5%) may develop complications. CONCLUSION: Otitis media is a common disease in our country, complications are rare, but should be suspected when the picture is of torpid evolution with clinical worsening and manifestation of neurological signs.",0,1644
1652,"INTRODUCTION: The maintenance of cerebral perfusion during shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position is controversial. The aim of this report is to present the first case in Mexico of a total shoulder arthroplasty performed with interscalene block and monitoring of the cerebral oxygen saturation. This monitoring was described in 1977, but only until the last decade has it reached relevance from the clinical point of view. CLINICAL CASE: We present an 84-year-old patient scheduled for total shoulder arthroplasty in beach chair position under regional anesthesia (ultrasound-guided interscalene block) in which the regional oxygen saturation (CrSO2) was monitored. DISCUSSION: Monitoring of cerebral oximetry is a suitable tool that allows us to have a continuous assessment throughout the transanesthetic, so we can make decisions more expeditiously. On this basis, we believe that this type of monitoring should be fundamental in patients placed in a beach chair position, as well as predominantly use regional anesthesia. In cases where it cannot be used, this monitor is absolutely essential.",0,1113
1653,"Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare disease that occurs in the setting of immunosuppression, associated with tolerogenic therapy used in allograft recipients or patients with hematologic malignancies. Clinically, it is characterized by a centrofacial cutaneous eruption of erythematous papules with a central keratinous spicule, often associated with variable degrees of alopecia. Histologic findings are characteristic, and electron microscopy reveals the presence of trichodysplasia spinulosa associated polyomavirus. We report a 47-year-old woman with idiopathic autoimmune pancytopenia refractory to diverse immunosuppressant regimens, with clinical and pathologic findings compatible with the disease, in whom complementary studies were required to exclude other differential diagnoses.",0,791
1654,"BACKGROUND: The ureteral disinsertion with bladder cuff technique continues to evolve. We present the endoscopic laser transurethral technique combined with a transperitoneal and retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach in lateral decubitus, without patient repositioning, for treating urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present 3 laparoscopic nephroureterectomies: 1 transperitoneal and 2 retroperitoneal. Disinsertion was performed in lateral decubitus using a flexible cystoscope and a 365-mum holmium laser fiber. The endoscopic technique was progressively adapted to 3-port and single-port retroperitoneoscopic approaches. Before laparoscopic handling of the kidney, ureter was clamped below the tumour. The endoscopic technique was then started. Both approaches were simultaneously employed. RESULTS: Nephroureterectomies were achieved performing en bloc endoscopic disinsertion of the bladder cuff and ensuring a closed system comparable to open technique. The second case required reconversion due to technical problems and extension of the surgical time. No relapses were diagnosed during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results are comparable to open surgery, technique ensured compliance to oncology principles, enabled disinsertion in lateral decubitus and avoid patient repositioning saving surgical time. The results reflect the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in all cases.",0,1424
1655,"The Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is an extremely rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The main difficulty for its diagnosis lies in the wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs that can occur in the disease process, leading, therefore, to there being no clear-cut algorithm as a guide for an optimal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. An 81-year-old male with history of diabetes insipidus was admitted due to non-specific respiratory signs. Imaging techniques revealed osteoblastic lesions in the lumbar spine. Whole-body bone-scintigraphy (BS) was performed, in which lesions involving the axial and appendicular skeleton, with different rates of osteoblastic activity, were observed. This highlighted a symmetrical severely intense uptake in the knees, leading to an accurate biopsy specimen that enabled making the definitive diagnosis. BS is a widely available, safe, and inexpensive technique that shows a characteristic pattern of uptake for ECD, thus its use is highly recommended for screening and guiding biopsy if clinical suspicion exists. Furthermore, when the scintigraphy pattern is incidentally observed, biopsy of increased uptake areas (tibia preferably) is mandatory in order to rule out the disease.",0,1236
1656,"Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by clonal proliferation of lymphocytes inside of small and medium caliber vessels. Its incidence is estimated at one case per million. The clinical picture is very variable, but frequently has skin and central nervous system involvement. It is diagnosed by demonstrating pathological blood vessel infiltration by lymphoma cells. We report a 44 years old male presenting with fever, malaise and erythematous lesions in the abdominal wall. An abdominal wall biopsy showed dilated vascular vessels with atypical cells in their lumen, compatible with large B-cell intravascular lymphoma. He was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone and an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, achieving a complete remission that has lasted two years.",0,887
1657,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate responsible for an aggressive infection (peridural and psoas abscess secondary to haematogenous septic arthritis) in a poultry farmer. METHODS: Molecular characterization was performed, including spa- and multilocus sequence typing of the isolate, assessment of its resistance phenotype and detection of tetracycline resistance and of virulence and immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes were performed. RESULTS: The MRSA isolate was tetracycline- and fluorquinolone-resistant, and was ascribed to CC398, spa-t1451. The isolate harboured tet(M) (distinctive of livestock-associated (LA) MRSA-CC398 clade) and IEC-type B system (characteristic of the methicillin-susceptible human lineage, but typically absent in LA-MRSA-CC398 strains), and lacked toxin-coding genes lukF/lukS-PV, tsst-1, eta and etb. CONCLUSION: IEC re-acquisition by LA-MRSA-CC398-LA strains is an unusual finding, but could constitute an emerging public health problem. It would represent an evolutionary step towards LA-MRSA-CC398's adaptation to human hosts, and might enhance its invasiveness and ability to be transmitted to humans.",0,1190
1658,"Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta and pityriasis lichenoides chronica represent 2 ends of a disease spectrum of unknown etiology. Herein we describe 2 cases of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, in which human herpesvirus 7 DNA was detected in skin samples by polymerase chain reaction methodology, an association not previously described. This report may support the involvement of viral infection in the etiopathogeny of this disease.",0,460
1659,"INTRODUCTION: Venous angiomas (VA) are benign entities; however infrequent symptomatic cases may occur. OBJECTIVE: Case report and literature review. CASE REPORT: A 6 year old girl was referred with a history of bi-frontal, non-pulsatile, headache with no nausea or vomiting. Headache intensity was 4-6/10. The episodes were frequent, 3-4 times per week. Triggers include academic work. Computed tomography showed a small VA in left caudate nucleus, which was confirmed by a brain MRI, with no evidence of inflammatory or ischaemic changes, or another vascular malformation. Psychological and psycho-pedagogic techniques were used, combined with relaxation and cognitive-behavioural techniques to reduce the intensity and frequency. There was a good outcome, and the headache decreased to 10 episodes per year. The patient was monitored for 12 years until graduation from high school. The VA remained without complications. CONCLUSIONS: In the study of a headache, a VA usually is an incidental finding. The International Classification of Headache Disorders III provides specific criteria of frequent episodic tension-type headache, and allows us begin specific therapy for it. Monitoring of non-symptomatic VA cases should be clinical. The surgical management of these entities is exceptional.",0,1295
1660,"Sickle cell syndrome HbS/beta thalassemia is an inheritable mendelian type disease where two affected alleles are simultaneously present, one from HbS (betaS) and the other from beta thalassemia. That situation is mainly linked to individuals who share African and Mediterranean ancestors. The mutation responsible for HbS is a point mutation, whereas for beta thalassemia, there are more than 200 mutations that cause different degrees of deficiency synthesis of beta globin chain, which justifies the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of this syndrome. It is presented a clinical case of a young adult man with limited resources that consulted by longstanding bone pain. The patient presented anemia with a marked microcytosis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed, an abnormal peak in position of HbS and high HbA2 fraction were detected. These last results indicated two possible molecular alterations simultaneously, for this reason the molecular study was performed looking for the most common beta thalassemia mutations in our population and, the point mutation responsible for S hemoglobinopathy. Clinical data and biochemical laboratory allowed the diagnosis of sickle cell syndrome. The molecular study confirmed the syndrome carrying mutations IVS-I nt 110 G > A, responsible for beta thalassemia and, codon 6 A > T (GAG --> GTG: Glu --> Val) responsible for S hemoglobinophaty. Since it is a disease of high health impact, it is important to provide genetic counseling to the whole family.",0,1506
1661,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy (PRES) is a condition characterized by T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, localized preferentially in the occipital-parietal white matter regions. Pathological MRI images located in midbrain, pons, medulla and spinal cord, that could be asymptomatic, were recently included in this entity. These images are interpreted as vasogenic edema, which is caused by arterial hypertension or eclampsia, neurotoxicity related to immunosuppressive agents or chemotherapy, among other causes. We report a 25 years old asymptomatic male with AIDS, with normal blood pressure who after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reported vertigo. The MRI showed a central pontine T2 hyperintensity with diffusion restriction, which was interpreted as a central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), but the lack of motor symptoms made improbable a real demyelination of the pons. The follow-up MRI revealed complete regression of the images. To our knowledge, this case could be the second report of a reversible leucopathy of the pons in a patient with AIDS, were the MRI images also simulated a CPM. This report extends the knowledge around the variability of the pathogenic interpretation of CPM images and their association with HAART.",0,1304
1662,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal aneurysmal bone cysts are very infrequent benign osteolytic lesions consisting of blood-filled cavities that are separated by osteo-connective septa and osteoclast-type giant cells. Clinically they manifest with local pain, neurological symptoms secondary to spinal cord compression, and fractures, deformities and vertebral instability. We report a case of an aneurysmal bone cyst in the thoracic spine with neurological signs and symptoms treated by means of a full microsurgical resection, with no associated neurological sequelae. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old woman, with no previous history of traumatic injuries, who was examined following several weeks with clinical signs and symptoms of paraesthesia in the lower limbs. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging revealed the existence of a lytic lesion with clearly defined edges and marginal sclerosis in T4, in addition to involvement of the posterior vertebral elements and compression of the underlying spinal cord. The whole lesion was removed surgically, and the sensitive clinical symptoms disappeared after the procedure. The definite pathological diagnosis was spinal aneurysmal bone cyst. CONCLUSION: Despite their low incidence, aneurysmal bone cysts of the spine must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of spinal bone tumours as a possible cause of subacute or chronic compressive myelopathy. Full surgical removal of the tumour is considered the preferred treatment, which is often curative and is associated with a good prognosis of the patient in the long term.",0,1565
1663,"Gastric varices occur in one-third of patients with portal hypertension. Bleeding from gastric varices remains a significant cause of death. Currently the first-line of treatment for gastric varices is endoscopic obliteration with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Though relatively safe, this option has several well-known complications. We report the case of a 61-year-old male patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis, who presented with fever, tachycardia and hypoxemia after endoscopic obliteration with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Radiographic findings were consistent with pulmonary embolism of the sclerosing substance. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the clinical and radiological findings of this complication in order to distinguish it from other similar medical conditions and prevent a delay in diagnosis.",0,812
1664,"UNLABELLED: Morbid obesity is a risk factor for numerous diseases including liver disease with an incidence of hepatic steatosis from 70 to 80%. Although surgical treatment is effective in reducing weight, its effects on the liver have not been established convincingly. We report 2 cases of patients with bariatric surgery and who had a fulminant hepatic failure resulting in death. METHODS: case N. masculine 1: a 36-year-obesity intervened in 1995 with VBG with BMI 52.5 to reganancia weight back after revision surgery is performed in 2009 performed distal gastric bypass. Case N. masculine 2: 42 Woman surgery for obesity in 2009 by distal gastric bypass with a BMI of 51 and placement of prophylactic Composix kugel midline mesh. After 3 years with good weight loss, presents abscess wall and enterocutaneous fistula he was surgically intervene. extracting mesh, identifying themselves two fistulas in alimentary and common intestinals loops that are removed and new anastomosis was performed. RESULTS: case N. masculine 1: at 2 months of revision surgery, tje patient starts vomiting secondary to stenosis of gastrojejunostomy anastomosis and symptoms of progressive jaundice, ascites and encephalopathy fulminant hepatic failure resulting in death. Case N. masculine 2: in the immediate postoperative period starts increased drainage of debit and rise of liver enzymes cytolysis and coagulopathy. It reinterviene on suspicion of anastomotic leak and abdominal Sepsis, developing fulminant hepatic failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy is treated by MARS system, and died within 4 hours of the onset of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: although current surgical techniques of bariatric surgery are considered quite safe, there have been cases of hepatic failure, unclear whether this would relate to the progression of a preexisting steatohepatitis, or may have other predisposing factors related to surgery. Treatments available, the emergency orthotopic liver transplantation is one of the best interventions. For our patients the outcome was fatal triggering the death of both. In both cases presented a septic shock with positive ascitic fluid cultures to multiresistant microorganisms, and both had revision surgery.

1666,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the characteristics and progression of patients treated with a 0.7mg dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex((R))) and required glaucoma filtering surgery (phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy) to control ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS: A retrospective observational study including patients treated with Ozurdex((R)) in a tertiary-care university hospital from May 2011 to April 2016. RESULTS: In five years of follow-up, 1.10% (4/363) of patients treated with 0.7mg dexamethasone intravitreal implant required phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (PNPDS) to control OHT refractory to topical treatment. All four patients started or increased previous antihypertensive topical treatment since the first dexamethasone intravitreal implant. Three or more dexamethasone intravitreal implants were injected in the four cases before intraocular pressure (IOP) became uncontrolled and PNPDS was performed. All four patients have a successfully controlled IOP without treatment after PNPDS. Two patients required additional treatment with dexamethasone intravitreal implants after PNPDS, maintaining IOP under control without treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing the successful results of PNPDS in OHT secondary to dexamethasone intravitreal implant. All four patients have achieved controlled IOP without treatment. Re-treatment with dexamethasone intravitreal implant in those patients who underwent PNPDS is also possible, and IOP remains controlled.",0,1532

Throughout the evolution of the disease, he had a macular oedema treated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept, with adequate recovery of visual acuity. He also had episcleritis on the other eye. Papillophlebitis is a non-ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion of inflammatory cause. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic necrotising vasculitis characterised by lesions of small and medium sized arteries. Ocular involvement occurs in 10-20% of patients, and typically affects the choroidal arteries.

1669,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction. It is characterized by variable weakness and excessive fatigability of skeletal muscles. In the last few years, numerous reports have been published showing the association between autoimmune diseases, such as systemic erythematous lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, with lymphoid neoplasias. The association between MG and lymphoid neoplasia seems to be less frequent. To analyze this association we reviewed the MG patients in the Department of Neurology, Hospital Salvador of Santiago, Chile. During a three-year period we identified four patients who developed different lymphoproliferative disorders: two with B-cell lymphoma, one with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and one plasmacytoma with an associated amyloidosis. The MG was generalized but mild, all cases classified as type IIa according to the definition proposed by the MG Foundation of America. The neoplasia appeared two to 36 years after the onset of MG. These cases provide additional evidence of the association between MG and lymphoproliferative disorders.",0,1105
1670,CASE REPORT: A 53 year-old woman with a stage 2 macular hole received ocriplasmin injection as a first approach. She subsequently underwent pars plana vitrectomy due to enlargement of the hole post-injection. The visual gain following the surgery was minimal despite closure of the hole. This could be explained by outer retina atrophy as a consequence of potential toxic mechanisms related to ocriplasmin. DISCUSSION: Further studies may be warranted to fully understand the impact of ocriplasmin on long-term visual function.,0,527
1671,"Septic shock sometimes starts with unspecific symptoms that hamper the clinical diagnosis and, therefore an appropriate treatment. When the septic shock follows a fulminating course with a fatal outcome, the etiological diagnosis has to be conducted post-mortem. Sudden unexpected deaths in children and young adults are frequently the object of medico-legal autopsies. Some sudden unexpected deaths have an infectious origin, which requires further analyses, including microbiology, to establish the cause of death. Here, the case of a fatal septic shock in a 19-month old male infant is presented. After a mild foot injury, an infection by Streptococcus pyogenes progressed to septic shock with a fatal outcome as post-mortem studies demonstrated.",0,749

The most accepted treatment consists in curetagge and filling with graft. However, certain locations may be inaccesible for surgery and represent therapeutical challenges. We present the case of an 11 year-old male patient with limping and right hip pain without any traumatic nor infectious record. In the image studies with CT and MRI a lytic and expansive lession was found in the upper part of the right acetabulum and right iliac wing, all of which suggested an aneurysmal bone cyst with an associated acetabular fracture. A biopsy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis. He was treated with a CT-guided embolization and, due to its size, curetagge and allograft filling afterwards.

1674,"BACKGROUND: Synchronous multiple primary malignancies in the female genital tract are infrequent. From 50 to 70% of them corresponds to synchronous cancers of the endometrium and ovary. To our knowledge, this is only the third case report in the international literature of three concurrent gynaecological cancers of epithelial origin. A case is presented, as well as a literature review due to the infrequency of its diagnosis and the lack of information on the subject. CLINICAL CASE: A 49-year-old woman, with previous gynaecological history of ovarian endometriosis. She underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, as she had been diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. The final histopathology reported synchronous ovarian, Fallopian tube, and endometrial cancer. An extension study and complete surgical staging was performed, both being negative. She received adjuvant treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She is currently free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology is uncertain. There is controversy relating to increased susceptibility of synchronous neoplasms to pelvic endometriosis and inherited genetic syndromes. Its diagnosis needs to differentiate them from metastatic disease. Additionally, they are problematical from a clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic point of view. The presentation of more cases of triple synchronous cancers is necessary for a complete adjuvant and surgical treatment.",0,1454

1677,"INTRODUCTION: Umbilical laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery represents an excellent alternative to laparoscopic or robotic multiport surgery. LESS surgery offers faster recovery, less postoperative pain and optimal cosmetic results. The reusable nature of its instruments also has significant economic advantages. PATIENT AND METHOD: We present a 34-year-old patient with a solid mesorenal lesion measuring 8 cm in the left kidney treated with pure LESS radical nephrectomy assisted by vaginal extraction of the specimen. The umbilical approach using a single-site multichannel KeyPort (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) with DuoRotate curved instruments allows for minimum crushing and fewer spatial conflicts. Its perfect umbilical adaptation provides a hermetic system. The instrument's double rotation provides considerable movement precision. Vaginal extraction avoids damage to the abdominal wall and the need for widening the umbilical incision. RESULTS: After the placement of the device and triangulation of the clips, we proceeded to operate on posterior parietal peritoneum. The descending colon was mobilized to access the retroperitoneum and dissect the renal hilum. Hem-o-lok clips were placed on the artery and vein, which were subsequently sectioned. The specimen was inserted into a laparoscopic bag. Under direct vision, we placed a 15-mm trocar through the bottom of the vaginal posterior fornix to facilitate the extraction of the bag's thread. The incision was widened with the fingers, and the specimen was extracted, closing the vagina from the perineum with visualization from the navel. Abdominal drainage was not employed. The surgical time was 180 min. The patient was discharged the following day without needing analgesia. A year later, the patient was disease-free and had no complications. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical LESS radical nephrectomy with vaginal extraction is feasible in selected cases. The procedure is oncologically safe, avoids scars and facilitates early recovery. From a practical point of view, this approach greatly simplifies natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and enables a minimally invasive equivalent result.",0,2193

1680,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and typically rapidly progressive form of atypical pneumonia, which spread from Asia to many parts of the world in early 2003. Clinical diagnosis of SARS requires the presence of unremitting fever and progressive pneumonia despite antibiotic therapy, particularly in the presence of lymphopenia and raised transaminase levels. We report the case of a woman who had undergone a successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. She presented initially with fever and a normal chest radiograph. Her indolent clinical course of SARS was punctuated by resolution of fever, but there was progressive radiologic deterioration and increasing serum antibody titer against SARS coronavirus. Treatment with oral prednisolone and ribavirin normalized her lymphopenia, altered transaminases, chest radiograph and high-resolution computed tomography appearances rapidly. Our experience should alert other clinicians in recognizing this atypical indolent presentation of SARS, to protect health care workers and the community at large and to ensure that these patients are properly treated.",1,1163
1681,"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer ranks fifth among oncological diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract; nevertheless, it is the world's most common malignant tumor of the bile ducts. It is usually diagnosed after cholecystectomy and tends to have bad prognosis. Adenocarcinoma is the main histological finding, although other rare histologic types have been described among the actual literature. Poorly differentiated squamous-cell neuroendocrine gallbladder carcinoma is an extremely rare neoplasm. A poor prognosis is associated with this histological type. AIM: The aim of this paper is to show that performing a systematic exploration of the entire peritoneal cavity in all laparoscopic surgeries can lead to find completely unexpected changes related to an unidentified disease. Also, a detailed review of our unexpected finding is made: The neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of gallbladder. CLINICAL CASE: We hereby report the case of a 40-year-old patient with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy that underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery, presenting the incidental finding of a small-cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Our surgical group advised that by introducing the laparoscope, the entire peritoneal cavity must be systematically reviewed, in search of differential diagnoses and unidentified pathologies. We must use the diagnostic and therapeutic qualities of laparoscopy. Bile duct endocrine tumors tend to remain silent until advanced stages, making the prognosis usually unfavorable, especially when they are unresectable. Endocrine neoplasias of the gallbladder, although uncommon, should be taken into account as possible diagnoses due to its therapeutic and prognostic implications.",0,1720
1682,"The novel Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MeRS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been reported as a cause of acute myocarditis.

The serum creatinine level was found mildly elevated. Chest radiography revealed in the lower lung fields accentuated bronchovascular lung markings and multiple small patchy opacities. Laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis. Sputum sample was positive for MeRS-CoV. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute myocarditis. the patient had all criteria specified by the international Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis that make a clinical suspicion for acute myocarditis. this was the first case that demonstrated that MeRS-CoV may cause acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure.",1,1047
1683,"CASE REPORT: An 84 year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a painless swelling with small purulent discharge in her left upper canaliculus, and an associated epiphora of one-month duration. The patient was diagnosed with acute primary canaliculitis. She was treated with topical and oral antibiotics, as well as topical corticoids for three months, with little response. Surgical treatment with left upper canaliculotomy and curettage was then performed, and Gemella haemolysans was identified from the curetted material. The patient had no recurrence of the disease two months after the surgery. DISCUSSION: This is the first time that Gemella haemolysans is described as unique agent causing primary canaliculitis.",0,722
1684,"INTRODUCTION: Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare clinical entity with higher incidence in women (3:1) and an age of presentation between 20 and 40 years. The hip is a rare site of appearance, being involved in only 15% of all cases. CASE REPORT: 47-year-old male with 10 years of evolution characterized by a limited range of motion, pain associated with an increase in volume and shortening of the pelvic limb. Imaging studies showed destruction of the hip joint and extension to the pelvis. The histopathology report described pigmented villonodular synovitis. His final treatment was left hemipelvectomy. DISCUSSION: The presentation of the diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis of the hip has a lower incidence and a locally aggressive behavior. It is necessary to consider differential diagnoses that include malignant neoplasms. The standard treatment is surgical.",0,888
1685,"We report the case of a 65-year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis who developed aortitis secondary to giant cell arteritis. She presented with a 2-mounth history of dry cough, fever and fatigue. There was no evidence of tumor or infectious processes. Abdominal computed tomographic and computed tomography coronary angiographic findings were suggestive of aortitis. Histological study of a temporal artery biopsy confirmed temporal arteritis. We also review the available literature on this uncommon condition.",0,511
1686,"Thyroid storm is a rare and potentially fatal condition. Unusual presentations in patients with thyroid storm have been described but multiorganic dysfunction is uncommonly seen. We describe the case of a 36-year-old woman with unknown underlying Graves's disease who developed thyroid storm. The thyroid storm score of Burch and Wartofsky was 50/140. This was complicated by acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, lactic acidosis, heart failure, bi-cytopenia, coagulopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The severe multiorgan dysfunction was reversed by prompt institution of steroids, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange before thyroidectomy. Main difficulty lies in recognizing its varied presentations and offering appropriate treatment when physician faces either failure or contraindications of conventional therapy.",0,815
1687,"BACKGROUND: Scimitar syndrome consists in a rare malformation characterized by a partial abnormal connection in one or both right pulmonary veins to the inferior vena cava, right lung hypoplasia and systemic circulation from the descending aorta. Scimitar syndrome is occasionally associated to other congenital malformations, such as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). CASE REPORT: We report a 4-year-old patient with ""adult"" variety of scimitar syndrome associated to symptomatic PDA, which was successfully occluded using retrograde guidewire-established femoral arteriovenous loop with an Amplatzer(R) PDA occluder, without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Scimitar syndrome is complex and requires a complete hemodynamic study for the determination of the appropriate treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a factor associated with poor prognosis.",0,851
1688,"A 45 year-old man with bilateral acute angle-closure and myopia after starting treatment with topiramate, secondary to alcohol and heroin dependence. Using Visante(R) OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) and B-scan Ultrasound he was diagnosed with bilateral ciliochoroidal effusion as the pathophysiological mechanism. Topiramate was stopped and ocular hypotensive therapy with a topical cycloplegic and corticosteroids were started, resolving ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome. Visante(R) OCT and B-scan Ultrasound are useful tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with acute angle-closure and myopia due to topiramate. As a result of broad spectrum of indications for topiramate, physicians and ophthalmologists should be aware of the possible ophthalmological manifestations attributable to this drug.",0,812
1689,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is at present, a useful treatment for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The crucial step toward consistent DBS outcomes remains careful patient selection; several conditions must be fulfilled including excellent levo dopa response. We report two cases of early onset Parkinson's disease with severe intolerance to levo dopa but excellent and sustained response to DBS. DBS can be a useful alternative for parkinsonian patients with severe intolerance to levo dopa, provided a positive acute response to levo dopa or apomorphine is obtained.",0,603
1690,"Chorangiomas are the most common non-trophoblastic tumors, generally appearing as incidental findings at the moment of delivery. The presence of leiomyomas inside placental parenchyma has been also described sporadically. In these cases, leiomyomas were primary maternal uterine neoplasms incorporated into the placenta during pregnancy. This case report presents a very unusual case of mesenchymal lesion, located in the fetal surface of the placenta, characterized by combined histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of chorangioma and leiomyoma. A single case reported with these characteristics was found in the international scientific literature, named as ""chorangioleiomyoma"". To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in our country.",0,758
1691,"N. meningitidis serogroup W has recently been introduced into Chile. This serogroup has been associated with hypervirulent strains capable of causing outbreaks. Furthermore, there is data suggesting that the spectrum of clinical manifestations varies among different serogroups. Here we describe three cases of community acquired respiratory infections caused by N. meningitidis W, which were diagnosed by blood culture during 2013 in our hospital.",0,448
1692,"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the production of the local toxocara antibodies in the vitreous of patients with negative serology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of patients seen in a Tertiary Referral Hospital, and at an Eye Institute, with an ocular diagnosis of toxocariasis who had a negative serology and positive titres in the vitreous. RESULTS: After reviewing the medical records of 40 patients with a diagnosis of ocular toxocariasis, a total of six cases (15%) were found with a negative serology and a positive vitreous titre for toxocara antibody, both of them performed using an ELISA procedure. The mean age was 18 years, there were no differences observed between males and females. A peripheral granuloma was the most common clinic finding, and all patients underwent vitrectomy either to remove epiretinal membranes or to repair retinal detachments. CONCLUSION: A negative serology does not rule out a diagnosis of ocular toxocariasis. Vitreous samples may be necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis.",0,1050
1693,"BACKGROUND: Mediastinal tumours in children are rare. Around 25% of them can be malignant. The thymoma is an uncommon neoplasm, and during adulthood it corresponds to 30% of anterior mediastinum tumours. The peak incidence is between 55-65 years. CLINICAL CASE: A case of lymphocytic thymoma case is reported in a 4 year old patient with no previous or associated symptomatology. There was only a volume increase on the anterior neck region. The neck radiography and neck and chest tomography confirmed an anterior mediastinal mass surrounding the aorta and vena cava, as well as multiple mediastinal lymph nodes CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and complete resection are the basis for management and prognosis.",0,708
1694,"CASE REPORT: A 60-year old patient was referred for cataract surgery. The examination showed retrokeratic pigment in the left eye, which had an intraocular pressure of 24 mm Hg. The funduscopy showed a brown lesion on the left optic disk, with adjacent vitreous seeding of pigment. The patient was thus diagnosed with secondary pigment dispersion syndrome due to optic disk melanocytoma. DISCUSSION: Although melanocytoma is most commonly a benign, stationary tumor, it may present with major complications leading to significant visual loss. A patient with melanocytoma of the optic disk should be examined periodically.",0,621
1695,"Behcet's disease is a systemic vasculitis characterized by the presence of oral and genital ulcers. Neurological involvement or neuro-Behcet is an uncommon manifestation. It manifestation has predominance in the male gender appearing 2 to 4 years after the first clinical manifestation. However, neuro-Behcet disease sometimes occurs with pseudotumoral brain lesions. Herein, we present the cases of two patients diagnosed with neuro-Behcet after detection of pseudotumoral brain lesions. A review of the literature is performed.",0,529
1696,"Invasive fungal infection has increased in frequency over the last decade, with fungal sinusitis becoming more frequent. The fungi of the genus Exserohilum (family Pleosporaceae, order Pleosporales) are filamentous and dematiaceous of ubiquitous location. It is an emerging pathogen, which in most cases produces a systemic infection that mainly affects the paranasal sinuses and lungs. It is more common in immunosuppressed patients, although it may occur in immunocompetent patients. The treatment is based on three pillars: antifungal treatment, surgical debridement and restitution of immunity. We present the case of a patient with medullary relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with invasive fungal sinusitis by Exserohilum rostratum.",0,743
1697,"Ralstonia pickettii is a low-virulence gram-negative bacillus that may be associated with infections related to health care and may cause bacteremia. Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia is uncommon but is related to the contamination of medical products, mainly in immunodepressed patients. We present two cases of patients on chronic hemodialysis with Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia linked to contamination of the dialysis water. Similar cases have been published with links to intravenous fluid administration, medication ampules, and the use of extracorporeal oxygenation membranes, among other factors. The detection of Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia should provoke suspicion and a search for contaminated medical products, fluids, and/or medications.",0,750
1698,"Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate at cold temperatures. Their presence can be related to a type of vasculitis referred to as cryoglobulinemia. This condition, especially mixed cryoglobulinemia, has been associated with viral infections like hepatitis C virus in 60%-90% of cases, but it has also been reported in relation to connective tissue diseases, usually resulting in a more severe course. We describe the case of a patient with seronegative polyarthritis who developed acute arterial ischemia in association with cryoglobulinemia, with a good response to rituximab therapy.",0,597
1699,"A series of paediatric patients is presented in whom topical interferon alpha-2b was used as a co-adjuvant treatment for conjunctival papilloma. This condition is frequently associated with human papillomavirus infection. There is little information on the pediatric population with the use of interferon for the treatment of these lesions. In this case series, adjuvant treatment with topical interferon alpha-2b in paediatric patients showed no recurrence and good tolerance.",0,477
1700,"Phrenic nerve block is a complication that can occur after brachial plexus anaesthesia above the clavicle. The main consequence of this blockage is ipsolateral diaphragmatic paralysis, which can sometimes lead to the appearance of post-operative respiratory complications. A case is presented on a woman, who after having undergone a total shoulder prosthesis, presented with dyspnoea in the post-operative recovery unit. A diaphragmatic ultrasound was performed that enabled a rapid diagnosis to be made of a complete paralysis of the ipsolateral hemi-diaphragm. Given the suspicion of phrenic nerve block, ultrasound has proven to be a rapid diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity. Its use can anticipate the possible development of immediate complications, and act as a guide in choosing the appropriate therapeutic strategy for each case in an early manner. In this case it enabled us to treat early with oxygen therapy, interscalene catheter removal, and intensive surveillance.",0,998
1701,"In September 2015, a confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was diagnosed in a healthcare worker in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Given the absence of confirmed MERS cases in Jeddah at the time, an epidemiological index case investigation took place. The investigation identified a probable source of an index case who had been in hospital in Jordan in August 2015 while there was an ongoing MERS outbreak and who then subsequently sought medical care in Jeddah.",1,473
1702,"During the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak, we experienced atypical presentations of MERS-CoV infections in three immunocompromised hosts that warranted exceptional management. Case 1 showed delayed symptom development after a four-day asymptomatic period, Case 2 experienced a 20-day incubation period, and Case 3 exhibited persistent viral shedding without clinical deterioration. Recognizing these exceptions is extremely important in the management of MERS-CoV-exposed or -infected patients and for control of potential MERS outbreaks.",1,533
1703,"A case of acute annular outer retinopathy (AAOR) is presented in a patient that was later proved to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aetiology of AAOR remains unknown, although a viral infection or an autoimmune mechanism has been suggested. The case presented here is noteworthy because it is the first case described in a patient with HIV positive serology. Even so, the precise role played by HIV infection or secondary immunosuppression in the development of the AAOR is not known.",0,512
1704,"OBJECTIVE: Turicella otitidis is a gram-positive bacillus coryneforme described, after 16S RNA sequencing, in 1994 by Funke et al as a microorganism involved in otitis media, and it is in health conditions a habitual colonizer of the external auditory canal. Since its description, more than twenty years ago, few cases of otitis related to or directly attributed to this microorganism have been published. METHODS: Description of a case of mastoiditis that required surgery and other cases of otic pathology in which T. otitidis was isolated, in the second semester of 2017 in our institution. They were reported only when they grew in pure culture. The identification was made by mass spectrophotometry and an antibiogram was performed. RESULTS: In our institution in the second half of 2017, 5 cases of otitis media were documented, some of them complicated, in which T. otitidis was isolated. The most of patients were children with recurrent otic pathology, and in some cases the sample was taken before the administration of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Since the inclusion of new vaccines that protect against microorganisms typically causing otitis media, is possible there are a change in the etiology of this disease and that microorganisms anecdotally isolated until now have become protagonists. The improvement in the microbiological identification provided by tools such as mass spectrometry will help to clarify if there are or not a change in the etiology of these diseases.",0,1487
1705,"AIM: To offer data on the phenotype determined by microdeletions of alpha exons in the NRXN1 gene. CASE REPORTS: Three neuropaediatric cases of intragenic microdeletions of NRXN1 alpha are studied. The phenotype of these three cases is unspecific, with mild-moderate mental retardation, behavioural disorders and slight dysmorphic traits or malformations. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype found in the microdeletions of alpha exons of the NRXN1 gene is clearly distinguishable from the one found in the microdeletions of beta exons, with macrocephaly, epilepsy and mental retardation.",0,578
1706,CASE REPORT: Myopic magna with narrow anterior chamber that presented with a secondary angle closure due to lorazepam. DISCUSSION: Angle closure usually occurs in predisposed patients and is triggered by precipitating factors. Many drugs routinely used in clinical practice could act as a factor responsible for the secondary angle closure.,0,340
1707,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the different treatments for postoperative chylous fistulae. METHODS: A literature review of the main treatments for postoperative chylous fistula, providing our initial experience of two cases of patients with postsurgical chylorrea, with conservative treatment. RESULTS: There is very limited experience in the treatment of chylous ascites. According to the literature reviewed, Octreotide (somatostatin analogue) can be used, to decrease fistula output. Both our cases cases were treated successfully with subcutaneous octreotide, with drain debit decrease in about 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: The use of octreotide appears to be an effective treatment in the management of chylous fistulae, and it is suggested by some authors as first-line treatment in the management of these, thus decreasing the complications that can appear due to chyle loss.",0,866
1708,"In this report, we describe a case of pneumonia due to an infection with human coronaviruses (HCoVs)-OC43 in a pediatric leukemia patient with Down syndrome and febrile neutropenia. Not only the recently discovered HCoVs NL63 or HKU1 but also the prototype strains HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E have to be considered as respiratory pathogens in immunocompromised pediatric cancer patients. The routine utilization of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tools would certainly elucidate the etiology of a relevant proportion of pneumonias of unknown origin in immunocompromised pediatric patients and would contribute to a better understanding of the role of HCoVs in this setting.",1,680
1709,Cystic parathyroid adenoma is a rare disease (<0.01% of all cervical masses) that associates primary hyperparathyroidism in 9% of cases. Parathyroid scintigraphy is essential for its diagnosis with uncommon false negative results. Hybrid SPECT/CT equipments allow a more accurate diagnosis. Functional cystic parathyroid adenomas are surgically treated. A case of a 64-year-old woman with diagnoses of hyperparathyroidism and a cystic parathyroid adenoma without uptake in scintigraphy is described.,0,499
1710,"Remote cerebellar haemorrhage is a rare but serious complication after spinal surgery. Although the mechanism is not well known, it always occurs after loss of cerebrospinal fluid due to dural tear, not always identified, which produces remote venous bleeding. Prognosis depends largely on the severity of this bleeding. We report a case of 67-year-old female who suffered a cerebellar and subarachnoid haemorrhage and subdural haematoma after elective lumbar fusion surgery and eventually required decompressive craniectomy.",0,525
1711,"Lynch syndrome is the most frequent syndrome in hereditary colorectal cancer, a family-specific deleterious mutations in genes encoding DNA reparation proteins: MLH1 (mutL homolog 1), MSH2, MSH6 (mutS homolog 2 y 6, respectively), PMS2 (PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component) y MUTYH (mutY DNA glycosylase). The c.2252_2253delAA, p.Lys751Serfs*3 mutation in MLH1 gene segregates with a haplotype reported in the northern region of Italy and whose origin was attributed to a founder effect. This mutation co-segregates with typical characteristics of Lynch syndrome, including early age at onset and multiple primary tumors in the same individual, a high frequency of pancreatic cancer, high microsatellite instability and lack of PMS2 expression. This report describes a mutation in an Argentinian patient with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of uterus. Her first-degree relatives had a history of colon cancer diagnosed before 50 years, fulfilling the Amsterdam Criteria I and Lynch syndrome II. The high pathogenicity associated to this mutation makes necessary the study of all members from families with hereditary cancer, allowing pre-symptomatic genetic diagnosis, early assessment and the instauration of preventive treatments.",0,1241
1712,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of an 11 year-old girl referring to a one year history of photophobia and continuously seeing white spots in both eyes. The patient had a visual acuity of unity in both eyes, and a normal eye examination, and was referred to the Neuro-ophthalmology Unit. Once complete laboratory and imaging tests ruled out the possibility of any neurological pathology, she was diagnosed with visual snow (VS). DISCUSSION: VS is an isolated symptom, possibly part of the migraine aura, that is referred by patients reporting numerous and constant white dots moving in the visual field of BE. It can significantly interfere with patient's daily activities by altering their quality of life, and ending up as a misdiagnosis. Paediatric patients also present a diagnostic challenge due to the complex interpretation that the presence of VS involves in them.",0,874
1713,"Sandhoff disease is a neurodegenerative, lysosomal and autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the HEXB gene. Three forms are recognized: infantile, juvenile and adult. Previously, an endogamous population in Cordoba, Argentina, was identified with a high incidence of Sandhoff disease, all reported cases were of the infantile type. In this work, we describe a child with the juvenile form of Sandhoff disease, the first case reported in Argentina. The patient is a 7-year-old boy presenting with ataxia, speech disturbances and global developmental delay, symptoms starting at the age of 2 years. Diagnosis was based on the hexosaminidase deficiency.

1714,"The current article analyzes the figure of the American bioethicist James Drane (1930). Drane not only played a crucial role in the birth of Bioethics in the United States, but was also instrumental in the inception and development of the field in Spain and Latin America. His <<sliding scale>> was the first dynamic tool encouraging a systematic evaluation of a patient's capacity to make healthcare-related decisions. However Drane's major contribution to the field was his application of virtue Ethics to the doctor-patient relationship. His proposal rests on the physician's compromise with the patient in all his/her dimensions. This goal will guide the physician's character and serve as compass, with which to exercise a virtuous practice, since only by exercising these virtues can doctors become truly good.",0,816
1715,"INTRODUCTION: The differential diagnosis of diseases that are accompanied by adult-onset girdle weakness is broad and includes motor neurone, neuromuscular junction or muscular diseases. The 8344A>G mutation of the MTTK gene of mitochondrial DNA usually presents with involvement of multiple organs associated (or not) with girdle weakness. To date no cases of isolated girdle weakness have been reported as the presenting symptom of this mutation. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old male, with a four-year history of isolated clinical signs of progressive girdle weakness. He is the brother of a 59-year-old woman with the same clinical features. Muscular biopsy played a decisive role in the diagnosis and was characteristic of mitochondrial myopathy. The genetic analysis revealed the 8344A>G mutation of the MTTK gene of mitochondrial DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The 8344A>G mutation of mitochondrial DNA can be associated with clinical signs and symptoms of adult-onset girdle weakness, and must therefore be included as part of its differential diagnosis.",0,1043
1716,"CASE REPORT: A 46 year-old man was seen in the emergency department complaining of vision loss and exophthalmos in his right eye. He also complained of headache, diplopia of 4 months onset, and neurosensory detachment that resolved spontaneously the month before. The study revealed tortuous conjunctival and episcleral vessels and neurosensory macular detachment in his right eye. A carotid-cavernous fistula was confirmed by computed tomography angiography. The fistula closed spontaneously during the hospitalization. One month later, the neurosensory detachment disappeared again. DISCUSSION: Carotid-cavernous fistula should be included in the differential diagnosis of neurosensory macular detachments. These neurosensory detachments can resolve spontaneously 11 the fistula is closed.",0,791
1717,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is characterized by acute and subacute visual loss, produced by mitochondrial DNA mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The molecular study of a family with only one affected member is presented. RESULTS: In the index case and in her mother, the mitochondrial mutation m.11778G>A in the MT-ND4 was detected in the heteroplasmic state. The index case's sister, without ocular manifestations, asked for genetic counseling. The study of the mentioned mutation by Sanger sequencing identified it in an apparent homoplasmic state. However, by means of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the mutation was actually in a heteroplasmic state. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding genetic counseling, verifying a mutation in homoplasmic state is really important. We have observed that NGS allows us to discriminate between high levels of heteroplasmy and homoplasmy, meaning that it is a useful technique for the analysis of apparent homoplasmic results obtained with less sensitive technique, as Sanger sequencing.",0,1046

1719,"INTRODUCTION: Paraovarian cysts are very uncommon in children OBJECTIVE: To present a case of giant paraovarian cyst case in a child and its management using a modified laparoscopic-assisted technique CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old patient with a 15 day-history of intermittent abdominal pain, located in the left hemiabdomen and associated with progressive increase in abdominal volume. Diagnostic imaging was inconclusive, describing a giant cystic formation that filled up the abdomen, but without specifying its origin. Laboratory tests and tumor markers were within normal range. Video-assisted transumbilical cystectomy, a modified laparoscopic procedure with diagnostic and therapeutic intent, was performed with a successful outcome. The histological study reported giant paraovarian cyst. Cytology results were negative for tumor cells. The patient remained asymptomatic during the postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The video-assisted transumbilical cystectomy is a safe procedure and an excellent diagnostic and therapeutic alternative for the treatment of giant paraovarian cysts.",0,1091
1720,"Background: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory infection with a high (~35%) mortality rate. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike of MERS-CoV have been shown to be a therapeutic option for treatment of lethal disease. Methods: We describe the germline diversity and neutralizing activity of 13 potent human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. Biological functions were assessed by live MERS-CoV, pseudotype particle and its variants, and structural basis was also determined by crystallographic analysis. Results: Of the 13 mAbs displaying strong neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, two with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV)1-69-derived heavy chain (named MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33) showed the most potent neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV in vitro. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, and the combination of 2 mAbs demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. The structural basis of MERS-GD27 neutralization and recognition revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site. Conclusions: Our data provide new insights into the specific antibody repertoires and the molecular determinants of neutralization during natural MERS-CoV infection in humans. This finding supports additional efforts to design and develop novel therapies to combat MERS-CoV infections in humans.",1,1560
1721,"This paper describes a case report of a patient from the Sanatorio Agua de Dios-Cundinamarca diagnosed with histioid lepromatous leprosy with suspected resistance to polychemotherapy (PQT), making evident the importance of clinical criteria for initiating an alternative therapy given the limitations of paraclinical examinations. Resistance should be suspected and diagnosed early to prevent the progression of the disease; clinical and paraclinical criteria help to confirm diagnosis. In bacteriological studies, the Colombian semiquantitative scale should be replaced by the Ridley-Jopling logarithmic scale. Histopathological studies are conducted on all patients with Hansen's disease. Research on resistance is being implemented in the country, but its access limits the opportunity for support in therapy initiation.",0,823
1722,"Adenomyoepitheliomas of the breast are infrequent tumors with a variable histological appearance, and they can mimic several epithelial, myoepithelial and biphasic lesions of the breast. We have reviewed four cases of adenomyoepithelioma of the breast diagnosed between 2005 and 2015 in our institution (Hospital Clinico San Carlos). Mean age was 57years. All lesions were solid irregular masses located in the upper quadrants (3 of them in the right breast and one in the left), with an average size of 13mm. Microscopically 2 of them were tubular and the remaining 2 were lobulated subtypes. Hyaline, myxoid and cystic areas, peripheral pseudoinfiltration and satellite nodules were occasionally seen. Myoepithelial cells were fusiform and immunohistochemically they were actin, calponin, p63, S100 and CD10 positive and CKAE1-AE3 negative, with variable CK23BE12 and CK5/6 staining. In all cases lumpectomy was curative, no recurrences or malignant degeneration were observed.",0,979
1723,"CLINICAL CASE: A patient diagnosed with Duane syndrome underwent an augmented superior rectus transposition (SRT) to lateral rectus (LR) and medial rectus (MR) recession. Vertical, torsional deviation and diplopia were observed post-operatively. Removal of the Foster suture and superior rectus recession resolved the symptoms. DISCUSSION: SRT to LR is proposed in Duane syndrome with a favorable outcome. The benefit of SRT is open to debate. It could be an alternative for the vertical rectus transposition when MR recession has to be operated on in the same procedure, or in the immediate post-operative period, in order to decrease the risk of anterior segment ischaemia.",0,675
1724,"The syndrome of the trephined or craniectomized is commonly referred as neurological manifestations associated to skin flap depression and reversible after craneoplasty, which allows its differentiation from post-traumatic syndrome. We present the case of a male patient, 36 years old, with history of decompressive craniectomy. He evolved with sudden neurological worsening associated to syndrome of the trephined and recovery after craneoplasty. Physiopathology of the syndrome involves cerebrovascular, metabolic and cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamic disturbances as well as parenchymal hyperdynamic mechanisms. Cranioplasty is the gold standard treatment. Still, studies with statistical power are needed to assess correct surgical timing.",0,742
1725,"Paediatric actinomycosis is an infrequent infectious disease caused by Actinomyces spp. Cervicofacial infections are usually related to disruption in oral mucosal membranes. We discuss the case of a 15-year-old girl who refers an 8-month history of odynophagia and changes in her tone of voice after getting a tongue piercing. She received multiple antibiotic treatments with slight improvement. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma was diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy. The patient was referred to our Hospital for treatment but, when the biopsy was analyzed again, oncological pathology was excluded and oropharyngeal actinomycosis was diagnosed. She received a total of 6 months of antibiotic treatment with favorable evolution. While oral piercings have not been yet described as a risk factor for oropharyngeal actinomycosis, the mucosal disruption could favor the onset of this disease.",0,878
1726,"Varicella virus infection may develop into severe disease in immunocompromised children. There are few studies that describe the clinical presentation of varicella infection in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis when on biological therapy. OBJECTIVE: Describe the outcomes of patients with a diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, who acquired a varicella virus infection during treatment with biological therapy. CLINICAL CASES: A description is presented on 4 cases of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in children between 3 and 12 years old, who developed a varicella-zoster infection during treatment with different biological therapies. Two patients were taking anti-TNF agents, one an Anti IL-6 agent, and one patient a T cell costimulatory blockade agent. Two of them received varicella vaccination prior to the start of biological therapy. All of them received different therapies and had favourable outcome without developing complications. No significant differences were found as regards the type of biological therapy or history of previous vaccination. Biological therapy was suspended for at least 2 weeks in all patients, and was restarted without reactivation of arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: No serious complications were observed in this patient series of children with JIA treated with biological therapy associated with VZV infection.",0,1358
1727,"A different and rare type of atrophy with a predominant pattern in scapulo-peroneal distribution was described by Davidenkow in 1939. The syndrome was characterized by some researchers as a variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, however Davidenkow noticed that clinical and laboratorial manifestations did not corroborate exactly with this hypothesis. We describe a case of a female patient, 39 years-old, clinical picture similar to the syndrome described by Davidenkow, presenting scapulo-peroneal atrophy. Her first symptoms had appeared when she was 24, initially with proximal motor weakness in the upper limbs. This patient did not have family history of myopathy or neuropathy. Several tests were performed to exclude other syndromes that could be included in the differential diagnosis, by testing gene mutation, in addition to the physical examination and electromyography. The large spectrum of neuromuscular diseases makes difficult the diagnosis of Davidenkow's syndrome which always should be considered in the differential diagnosis.",0,1048
1728,"Pulmonary tumor embolisms (PTE) are an infrequent cause of dyspnea in oncological patients. The majority are diagnosed in patients with advanced tumors, above all localized in the breast, lung or stomach. There are few published cases involving patients with urothelial tumors. We present the case of a 69 year-old male, without a previous diagnosis of cancer, who was admitted due to subacute dyspnea, with clinical suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism (PT). The patient died on the fifth day of admission. The autopsy confirmed the existence of a tumor in the left renal pelvis with hepatic and lymphoganglionary metastasis and an extensive microvascular pulmonary embolism that affected a large part of the capillaries and medium-caliber blood vessels of both lungs. PTE were considered responsible for the progressive respiratory failure and as the final cause of death. The most frequent clinical presentation of PTE is dyspnea. They are often mistaken for PT and diagnosis is not easy. Their prognosis is very bad, with extremely high mortality and confirmation is usually post-mortem.",0,1093
1729,"A 57-year-old man with miliary tuberculosis reported visual loss in his right eye, a month after starting a four-drug antituberculous treatment regimen. On exploration, an inferior segmental optic disc edema was objectived and it was attributed to ischemic aetiology. Ethambutol was withdrawn and 60mg of oral prednisone daily were given with a tapering dosage. One and a half months later, he presented a sudden loss of vision in his left eye. In fundoscopy, a papillary edema accompanied by a foveal neurosensory detachment was observed but with no more accompanying uveitic signs. Treatment was intensified with moxifloxacin and corticosteroids were reduced, showing a resolution of the macular detachment but with optic atrophy. Isolated tuberculous involvement of the optic nerve may possible in the context of miliary tuberculosis. In this case, the adopted therapeutic approach to the initial papillitis, which was interpreted as ischemic, could favour the appearance of a neuroretinitis in the fellow eye.",0,1013
1730,"Anterior radial head dislocation in pediatric population is related to Monteggia fracture-dislocations. Isolated radial head dislocation is uncommon. Sometimes, radial head dislocation becomes irreducible. This entity can develop into chronic conditions such as nerve injuries, early osteoarthritis, limited range of motion and cubitus valgus. We describe a case of a 9-year-old patient who suffered elbow trauma. He was admitted to our institution 40 days after, where radial head dislocation was diagnosed. This condition was misdiagnosed at first stage. It was irreducible due to a tear in the annular ligament. He underwent open reduction. Radial head dislocation must be suspected even if there are no fractures or plastic deformity. Pure irreducible radial head dislocation is rare. Physical examination, together with plain bilateral radiographs and full acknowledgement of this rare condition are the basis to reach early diagnosis, which leads to proper non-delayed treatment.",0,985
1731,"Meningococcal infection associates high morbidity and mortality. Viral coinfection has been described mainly with herpes and respiratory virus. We describe a child who suffered a tonic-clonic seizure with hypotension, tachycardia and low Glasgow Coma Scale. She maintained an altered mental status and required hemodynamic stabilization in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Wide spectrum antibiotherapy was initiated. She suffered large and foul-smelling liquid not bloody stools which were cultured and studied by polymerase chain reaction. The cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Later the polymerase chain reaction stools were positive to astrovirus, and the blood polymerase chain reaction was positive to Neisseria meningitidis group B. As far as we know, this is the first case of astrovirus and Neisseria meningitidis coinfection described in children. This virus should be considered as new cause of viral coinfection to discard if unexplained abdominal pain or vomits and liquid stools are observed.",0,1005
1732,"Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma is an uncommon lesion arising from the peritoneal mesothelium. It is asymptomatic or presents with unspecific symptoms. Imaging techniques may reveal it, however the final diagnosis can only be made by histopathology. Surgery is the only effective treatment considering its high recurrence rate. We report a 19 years old male with Crohns disease. Due to persistent abdominal pain, an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a complex cystic mass in the lower abdomen. The patient underwent surgery and the lesion was completely resected. The pathological study reported a benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma.",0,678
1733,"Carney described a disorder characterized by the presence of several uncommon tumors which were pulmonary chondromas, gastric sarcomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas. We report a 14 year-old girl in whom multiple gastric tumors were discovered during a study of an iron deficiency anemia and was subjected to a partial gastrectomy. At 25 years of age, she developed several pulmonary chondromas and at 33 years, a mediastinal tumor with features of an extra-adrenal paraganglioma was found. At 35 years of age, a total gastrectomy was performed to remove a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with excision of peritoneal and lymph node metastasis. One year later, the patient died due to liver failure secondary to liver metastases.",0,729
1734,"Phyllodes tumors account for less than 1% of tumors of the mammary gland, have both epithelial and stromal components and are classified as benign, borderline and malignant. The malignant tumors are highly heterogeneous: they can differentiate to liposarcomas, fibrosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, chondrosarcomas or osteosarcomas. The differentiation to osteosarcoma is extremely rare, constitutes 1.3% of cases and is very aggressive. The standard treatment of these tumors is surgical. The role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is not clear. However, in patients in whom wide surgical margins are not achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy can be of help. We report a 63 years old female with a right breast osteosarcoma with an osteoclastic component, originating in a phyllodes tumor. The tumor was excised surgically and afterwards she was treated with 10 sessions of 50 Gy of radiotherapy in 25 fractions. She has remained free of disease for the last 10 months.",0,959
1735,"Neurolymphomatosis is a rare disorder characterised by infiltration of neoplastic lymphocytes into the peripheral nervous system. A wide variety of symptoms can manifest depending on its nature and location, making its diagnosis a real challenge.

We present the case of a male patient with neurolymphomatosis of the cauda equina, together with a review of all cases published to date.",0,519
1736,"Introduccion: El cancer colorrectal es un gran problema de salud por su alta incidencia y mortalidad. Las metastasis cutaneas son raras, con una incidencia < 5%. Caso clinico: Varon con antecedente de colectomia por neoplasia de colon que 6 anos despues presenta una lesion cutanea. La biopsia informa de metastasis colonica, por lo que se realiza reseccion quirurgica radical. La anatomia patologica confirma un adenocarcinoma moderadamente diferenciado compatible con metastasis colonica. Discusion y conclusiones: Las metastasis cutaneas son raras y cuando aparecen nos indican una enfermedad avanzada, por lo que es importante un alto indice de sospecha en pacientes de riesgo para un diagnostico precoz. Introduction: Colorectal cancer is a big health problem due to its high incidence and mortality. Cutaneous metastases are rare with an incidence < 5%. Clinical case: A male with a history of colectomy due to colon cancer, who 6 years later presented a cutaneous lesion. The biopsy reported colonic metastasis, so radical surgical resection was performed. The pathological anatomy confirmed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma compatible with colonic metastasis. Discussion and conclusion: Cutaneous metastases are rare and when they appear they indicate an advanced disease, for that reason is important a high index of suspicion in patients at risk, for an early diagnosis.",0,1390
1737,"Scorpionism in Tucuman is very frequent. The aim is to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of cases of scorpionism that were seen in the Emergency Department of Eva Peron Hospital, Banda del Rio Sali, Tucuman, between July 2013 and March 2015. Forty patients were assisted, 21 boys and 19 girls. The average age was 6.89 years. Thirty four (85%) resultedmild, 3 (7.5%) moderated, 3 (7.5%) moderated-severe. Hands (22.6%) and feet (20%) were the places in the body where the stings were more frequently localized. In only 3 cases the scorpion could be identified as Tityus trivittatus. Six (the moderate and moderate-severe cases) patients received specific antidote, with variable response. Although most of the cases were mild, this is an entity with severe prognosis in some patients. Epidemiological surveillance is necessary to arrange prevention measures, as we do in this Hospital.",0,909
1738,"OBJECTIVE: Basal cell carcinoma and leiomyoma of the scrotum are rare. We describe three cases of scrotal tumors and provide information regarding this disease. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2014, 3 patients with scrotal tumors were diagnosed and treated at our institution. A review was performed using the clinical records of these patients. RESULTS: We describe two cases of basal cell carcinoma of the scrotum in men 72 and 71 year old, who presented with a left scrotal lesion that was excised and the pathological diagnosis was basal cell carcinoma. In one patient, surgical margin was affected and a recurrent basal cell carcinoma appeared. It was excised with enlargement of surgical margin. We also describe a case of scrotal leiomyoma in a 48 year old man with an elastic, firm and nontender lesion in the right scrotum. During follow-up the patients remain clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Scrotal lesions in the elderly should be excised and submitted for pathological examination. The basal cell carcinoma of the scrotum appears as a plaque, nodule or ulcer. Long-term surveillance is recommended for these patients. Leiomyoma of the scrotum is presented as a non-ulcerative nodule and his treatment is complete surgical excision.",0,1244
1739,"CASE REPORT: The case concerns a 22 day-old male child with juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), which manifested as a unilateral glaucoma and with fibrinous haemorrhagic exudate in the anterior chamber affecting the angle of the right eye. Despite a high level of suspicion, the definitive diagnosis was not possible until the infant reached the age of 10 months, after the appearance of the skin lesions typical of this condition and histopathological study of them. CONCLUSION: JXG is a rare disease, characterised by yellowish skin lesions on the trunk, neck, or head. Up to 10% of cases will have ocular involvement, which is the most common extracutaneous manifestation of the disease.",0,686
1740,"Hemophagocytic syndrome is a severe condition of excessive immune activation that has a high mortality in the absence of treatment. The syndrome is classified as primary if associated with congenital or hereditary problems, or secondary/acquired if associated with infectious, autoimmune or oncology diseases. We report four adult cases of the syndrome, one with viral, two with autoimmune and one with idiopathic causes who were successfully treated with HLH 94-04 chemotherapy protocol. Our experience shows that a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis and an opportune therapy are essential in the treatment of this disease.",0,630
1741,"INTRODUCTION: Adrenal masses are uncommon in newborns. The differential diagnosis includes be nign masses (adrenal hemorrhage, extralobar pulmonary sequestration) and malignant ones (neuro blastoma) that may be a finding during an obstetric ultrasound. The use of complementary imaging methods allows a better diagnosis approach during the postnatal period, with implications for the management of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a female newborn with diagnosis of an adrenal mass, and to discuss differential diagnoses and management alternatives of adrenal lesions in newborns. CASE REPORT: Two-month-old female infant, referred for adrenal tumor study diagnosed at 22 weeks gestational age. Postnatal ultrasound showed a tumor compatible with neuroblastoma. The patient was asymptomatic, and the laboratory studies showed no relevant findings. The lesion was excised by laparoscopy. A histological study confirmed pulmonary sequestration. CONCLUSIONS: Extralobar pulmonary sequestration should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal mass in the newborn. Minimally invasive surgery should be the preferred surgical technique choice in these cases, given the technical feasibility and benefits in the recovery and cosmetic issues of the patient.",0,1282
1742,"Goodpasture Syndrome is described as a single episode disease entity. It is diagnosed with the demonstration of antiglomerular basement (anti-GBM) antibodies in plasma or renal tissue. Although the recurrence of anti-GBM disease is rare, it has been reported in up to 3% of cases. Recurrence with negative anti-GBM antibodies in plasma is even less frequent We report a 63 years old male in whom anti-GBM disease recurred without detectable anti-GBM antibodies in plasma, despite having positive antibodies at the onset.",0,520
1743,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment with lithium can cause several neurological side effects, even at therapeutic levels. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 49-year-old woman, with bipolar disorder and depression, undergoing treatment with lithium, antidepressants and antipsychotics, who was admitted to hospital due to a clinical picture of visual hallucinations with an elevated lithaemia of 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). The patient developed a severe encephalopathy that required the use of assisted ventilation in the intensive care unit. Initial magnetic resonance imaging showed a reversible bilateral symmetrical hyperintensity in the dentate nuclei in T2 and T2-FLAIR sequences. Over the following months she gradually developed a pancerebellar syndrome with evidence of a marked loss of bilateral volume in the cerebellum, above all at the expense of the vermis, which was accompanied by a permanent and disabling cerebellar syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with lithium can cause a variety of neurological side effects, they are usually reversible. However, they occasionally give rise to permanent and disabling sequelae, as in the case of the patient reported here, with a marked and progressive cerebellar atrophy, accompanied by permanent sequelae in the form of a disabling cerebellar syndrome. The cerebellar neurotoxicity of lithium must be taken into account in the broad differential diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia in adults.",0,1461
1744,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is the second most common malignancy of the urinary tract and the 9th worldwide. Latin American has an incidence of 5.6 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Seventy-five percent of newly diagnosed cases are nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, and 25% of cases present as muscle invasive. The mainstay of treatment for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer is loop transurethral resection. In 2013, the group led by Dr Mundhenk of the University Hospital of Tubingen, Germany, was the first to describe the Hybrid Knife((R)) equipment for performing en bloc bladder tumour resection, with favourable functional and oncological results. OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical technique of en bloc bladder tumour resection with a Hybrid Knife((R)) as an alternative treatment for nonmuscle invasive bladder tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A male patient was diagnosed by urotomography and urethrocystoscopy with a bladder tumour measuring 2x1cm on the floor. En bloc transurethral resection of the bladder tumour was performed with a Hybrid Knife((R)). RESULTS: Surgery was performed for 35min, with 70 watts for cutting and 50 watts for coagulation, resecting and evacuating en bloc the bladder tumour, which macroscopically included the muscle layer of the bladder. There were no complications. CONCLUSION: The technique of en bloc bladder tumour resection with Hybrid Knife((R)) is an effective alternative to bipolar loop transurethral resection. Resection with a Hybrid Knife((R)) is a procedure with little bleeding and good surgical vision and minimises the risk of bladder perforation and tumour implants. The procedure facilitates determining the positivity of the neoplastic process, vascular infiltration and bladder muscle invasion in the histopathology study.",0,1784
1745,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms are chronic disorders of clonal hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by an overproduction of functional granulocytes, red blood cells and / or platelets, and one of the major complications is the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombotic problems caused by increased platelet aggregation and thrombin generation. In this study 11 cases of primary myelofibrosis (PM) were evaluated and 2 debuted with splanchnic venous thrombosis (SVT); so after seeing the results of this study and of world literature, it is suggested that in patients with SVT, diagnostic methods for PM like the JAK2V617F mutation should be included.",0,654
1746,"Pai syndrome is a very rare congenital disorder characterized by medial cleft lip, nasal and facial cutaneous polyps, and pericallosal lipoma. Broad phenotypic variability exists in this condition. Neurodevelopment is usually normal. Up to date 42 cases have been reported in the literature.

We report two cases with Pai syndrome, one of them with novel clinical findings as vertebral segmentation defects and choroidal osteoma.",0,537
1747,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of corneal toxicity after migration of a dexamethasone implant into the anterior chamber. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old man with aphakia and a history of vitrectomy received a dexamethasone implant for a refractory Irvine-Gass syndrome. Thirty days later, the implant migrated into the anterior chamber causing endothelial contact with secondary corneal oedema that justified the removal of the implant without resolution of the oedema. DISCUSSION: Clinical tolerability to dislocated implant is poor in cases with pre-existing corneal oedema, and because of this, it must be removed early. In cases of aphakia and vitrectomy, the increased risk of Ozurdex((R)) dislocation justifies performing a prior endothelial count.",0,748

1749,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma belongs to the group of mature T-cell malignancies according to the WHO classification. It constitutes a rare entity and has a strong association with infection by human T-lymphotropic virus 1. In Uruguay, this viral infection is very infrequent and, to our knowledge, no case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma has been previously reported. We describe the case of a woman, immigrant from Peru, who presented with persistent lymphocytosis, intestinal parasitic diseases, and skin involvement. The diagnosis was delayed and the patient died before initiating oncological treatment. We therefore emphasize the relevance of an early clinical suspicion and serology for this virus, especially in patients coming from endemic countries like Peru.",0,772
1750,"Frontal fibrosing alopecia was recently described by Kossard, et al. as a progressive symmetrical recession of the frontal-temporal-parietal hairline affecting particularly postmenopausal women. Besides affecting the scalp, there are some cases in the literature with partial or total loss of the eyebrows, also involving the trunk, and superior extremities. Because the clinical, histological, and immunochemical findings are indistinguishable from those seen in lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia is now considered a localized variant of lichen planopilaris. We report four cases of Mexican postmenopausal women with this kind of dermatosis evaluated at the Dermatological Center Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua.",0,721
1751,"The spread to the cavernous sinus in laryngeal cancer means the presence of a disseminated disease and short survival. The aim of this paper is to report a case of laryngeal squamous carcinoma of the larynx. A search was conducted in the databases of Medline and SciELO DOYMA using the words ""cavernous sinus metastasis"". We found 10 published cases of laryngeal squamous carcinoma with metastasis to the cavernous sinus. The average survival of the 10 cases reported in the literature was 4.1 months; in our case it was 9 months. Patients who received radiotherapy improved symptomatically. In some cases the diagnosis was confirmed only after necropsy. In this type of lesions, surgery is used for diagnosis rather than as a therapeutic tool.",0,744
1752,"Iodine solutions are widely used as antiseptic for treating and preventing wound infections. Povidone iodine, one of the most common topical iodine solutions in emergency kits, can lead to several abnormalities as thyroid dysfunction. Povidone iodine poisoning is unusual and previously reported effects are mainly complications of topical usage during surgical procedures. Here we present the case of a newborn that was accidentally given oral povidone iodine, showing no signs or symptoms of toxicity after ingestion.",0,519
1753,"Multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a group of complex disorders that include psychiatric disorders, chronic fatigue and/or respiratory problems. This syndrome could be triggered by specific allergens and toxins that cause neurophysiological sensitization and the appearance of the clinical symptomatology. Anaesthesia for these patients always poses a challenge for the anaesthetist, because they need to find and use drugs that do not trigger or aggravate the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, sevoflurane in these circumstances might be ""the ideal anaesthetic"". Performing general anaesthesia with sevoflurane as the sole anaesthetic agent, together with a series of environmental measures formed the basis for successful anaesthesia and surgery in our patient with a multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome.",0,818
1754,"Macrosomia is a risk factor for birth injuries and is associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality. Cephalohematoma and clavicular fracture are the most frequent birth injuries. Intraabdominal injuries are uncommon birth injuries. Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is an accumulation of blood in the sheath of rectus abdominis muscle. It is associated with trauma, operations and anticoagulant therapy, especially in adults and elders. We present a macrosomic male neonate with difficult vaginal delivery, who had in the physical examination periumblical ecchymose of 1x1 cm and a parietal cephalohametoma of 1x1 cm. The abdominal ultrasonogram and the computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed a 7x4x2 cm right rectus sheath hematoma.",0,739
1755,"BACKGROUND: During the last few years a number of previously undescribed viruses, including human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses SARS, NL63 and HKU1, and bocavirus, were identified in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with signs of respiratory infections. These viruses may cause mild to life-threatening infections. OBJECTIVES: Nasopharyngeal samples from hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory disease were analysed for the presence of coronaviruses and other well known and newly identified respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two clinical cases of a severe obstructive pneumonia, which were associated with the presence of RNA of a novel variant (subtype) of HKU1 coronavirus in the nasopharyngeal aspirates, were identified. DISCUSSION: The detection of a HKU1-like coronavirus in pediatric patients in the current study complement the most recent independent finding of similar or closely related coronaviruses in patients with respiratory diseases in France (Vabret et al. 2006) and Norway (Jonassen et al., see accompanying manuscript). These observations indicate a wide dissemination of HKU1-like coronaviruses in Europe.",1,1138
1756,"Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by the presence of contracture and joint pain, hyperpigmented plaques and nodules and gingival hypertrophy. These findings are the result of the accumulation of a hyaline amorphous material similar to collagen type VI in different tissues. This syndrome includes systemic hyalinosis and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, two entities that for years were considered separately. However, it has been documented that the cause of both entities is located in the same gene and the clinical features and age of presentation are overlapped. In this study two cases of sisters from a same colombian family affected by the disease are presented.",0,716
1757,"BACKGROUND: Collision tumours are extremely rare. They are defined by the presence of two tumours of different histological origin in the same organ. CLINICAL CASE: A 71 year old female with history of a carcinoid tumour removed 20 years ago without any recurrence. The patient was admitted with intestinal occlusion symptoms secondary to a right flank abdominal tumour. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, removing the tumor and applying optimal debulking. The histopathological study reported bilateral ovary adenocarcinoma, as well as metastatic collision tumour of two histological types: well differentiated adenocarcinoma and a mixed malignant mesodermic Mullerian tumor. The patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy with poor results (death in 24 months). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of collision tumours is extremely rare. There are no statistics or specific treatment reported. Diagnosis is made with histopathology. At the moment, no similiar cases have been reported.",0,987
1758,"Acute thrombophlebitis of spermatic vein is an unusual pathology involving, in most of the cases, the left side, and whose etiology remains uncertain. Most of them are found during a a differential diagnosis in acute testicular pain. We introduce the case of a 29 years old male with abusive cocaine consumption, admitted to hospital due to severe testicular pain. Doppler-ultrasound examination was undertaken, showing right spermatic vein flux alteration. Conservative management was decided and anticoagulant and non-esteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were started. Eco-doppler is the most specific and sensible technique for diagnosis of these cases, while TC can always confirm etiologic diagnosis. Treatment was initially conservative based on anticoagulation. Hematological study is necessary in order to determine coagulation alterations.",0,846
1759,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by distinctive facial features, failure to thrive, microcephaly and several malformations associated. Its main endocrinological features are anomalies of the genitalia. We present a 13-year-old boy, who suffered from complicated aspiration pneumonia and showed Cornelia de Lange syndrome phenotype, with global developmental delay, suction-swallowing abnormalities, short stature and abnormal genitalia associated. His bone age was delayed, so he underwent full endocrinological panel. Central hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and low luteinizing hormone-follicle-stimulating hormone levels were observed and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies diagnosis was made. Basal cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin levels were normal. He received thyroid hormonal substitution. Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies are an unusual feature of De Lange syndrome. We suggest evaluating all different endocrine axes in these patients.",0,1015
1760,"Bronchial tumors are rare in children. Most of them are malignant, being the carcinoid tumor the most common. Less frequently the mucoepidermoid carcinoma is found in the tracheobronchial tree. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma accounts for 0.1 to 0.2% of all malignant bronchopulmonary tumors. It manifests with symptoms of airway obstruction and/or recurrent pneumonias. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are of great importance in the prognosis. Bronchoscopy with biopsy of the endobronchial mass is the method of choice to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of surgical resection of the lesion. We present an 11-year-old girl with dyspnea on exertion and cough due to a low malignant mucoepidermoid arcinoma of the ronchi. We describe the clinical manifestations, the diagnostic methods and the treatment of this rare neoplasia in pediatrics.",0,852
1761,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection causes an acute respiratory illness and is associated with a high case fatality rate; however, the pathogenesis of severe and fatal MERS-CoV infection is unknown. We describe the histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from the first autopsy performed on a fatal case of MERS-CoV in the world, which was related to a hospital outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in April 2014. The main histopathologic finding in the lungs was diffuse alveolar damage. Evidence of chronic disease, including severe peripheral vascular disease, patchy cardiac fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis, was noted in the other organs. Double staining immunoassays that used anti-MERS-CoV antibodies paired with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and surfactant identified pneumocytes and epithelial syncytial cells as important targets of MERS-CoV antigen; double immunostaining with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 showed colocalization in scattered pneumocytes and syncytial cells. No evidence of extrapulmonary MERS-CoV antigens were detected, including the kidney. These results provide critical insights into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans.",1,1211
1762,"Kawasaki disease is one of the most common systemic vasculitis in children and the most common cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries. Diagnosis relies on clinical findings and there is no specific test. Diagnosis and treatment decisions are very difficult in incomplete or atypical cases and questions inevitably arise during the care of these patients. In children with atypical or incomplete disease, the option in favor of therapy with gamma globulin seems currently to be the most suitable one. A patient with acute abdomen is presented as the initial symptom of Kawasaki disease.",0,601
1763,"Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become a fundamental tool in modern cardiothoracic anaesthesia. It has an indisputable role in coronary valve surgery and revascularisations with severe impairment of ventricle function. It helps in making diagnoses that can optimise the surgical strategy and to minimal invasively dynamically monitor volaemia and cardiac function during the post-operative period, detecting complications unobservable by other methods. The McConnell sign, visualised using TEE as an akinesis of the right ventricular free wall, with a normal apex motility and enlargement of the right cavities, is characteristic of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. This sign has a 77% sensitivity and 94% specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (APE). The case is presented of a 53-year-old man scheduled for aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement surgery, with a history of severe valve aortic stenosis, aortic root and arch aneurysm, and with normal coronary arteries. Post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP), the patient presented with haemodynamic instability, with the TEE showing a typical image of the McConnell sign, with no pulmonary hypertension. This enabled making an early diagnosis of acute RV ischaemia, that led to a change in the surgical plan, the performing of coronary revascularisation surgery. As a result, the McConnell sign, which describes the characteristics of RV dysfunction, led to making a differential diagnosis between APE, RV infarction and acute myocardial ischaemia.",0,1535
1764,"INTRODUCTION: Solitary fibrous tumor (TFS) is a rare tumor of mesenchymal origin, located mainly in the pleura. It is extraordinarily infrequent find it at the intraespinal level, being the thoracic region the most frequent. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 48-year-old patient with progressive ascending lower limb and myelopathy of one month of evolution, with intraspinal location at the D3-D4 level. It was surgically operated by posterior dorsal approach and D3-D4 laminoplasty, with an intradural tumor with an intramedullary component of approximately 18x12mm. The resection was complete and the pathological anatomy gave the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. The patient is currently asymptomatic. DISCUSSION: Complete tumor resection and histopathological features are the main prognostic factors. Surgery have a main role in this type of neoplasia. CONCLUSION: There are few case published of solitary fibrous tumor with intraspinal localization. We apport another case to the literature.",0,1012

1766,"Intrathecal injection of fluorescein is a method for repairing cerebrospinal fluid fistulas. The most frequent surgical procedure is endonasal endoscopy and the purpose of injecting this dye is to locate the fistula. The anaesthesiologists usually perform the puncture, therefore it is necessary to review this method and to specify some anaesthetic considerations such as correct dosing, safe management protocols and medical-legal aspects. In this case-report we describe the pre, intra and postoperative protocol of action implemented in our department that basically consists of: obtaining a specific consent, prior neurological/ophthalmologic assessment to rule out hypertension and brain damage, use of corticosteroids and previous antihistamines, choosing the correct dose and concentration of intrathecal sodium fluorescein (maximum 1ml at a concentration of 5% diluted in 9ml of cerebrospinal fluid) and close intra and postoperative monitoring.",0,954
1767,"Video-assisted thoracic surgery is traditionally carried out with general anaesthesia and endotracheal intubation with double lumen tube. However, in the last few years procedures, such as lobectomies, are being performed with loco-regional anaesthesia, with and without sedation, maintaining the patient awake and with spontaneous breathing, in order to avoid the inherent risks of general anaesthesia, double lumen tube intubation and mechanical ventilation. This surgical approach has also shown to be effective in that it allows a good level of analgesia, maintaining a correct oxygenation and providing a better post-operative recovery. Two case reports are presented in which video-assisted thoracic surgery was used, a lung biopsy and a lung resection, both with epidural anaesthesia and maintaining the patient awake and with spontaneous ventilation, as part of a preliminary evaluation of the anaesthetic technique in this type of surgery.",0,948
1768,"The most frequent diabetes-related complications are diabetic foot and glaucoma, which lead to amputation and loss of vision, respectively. Current scientific and technologic developments have permitted the design and implementation of prosthetic systems that are optimal for these patients, as the latter adapt themselves to them and can resume activities of daily living. The lack of economic resources compromises the quality of the prostheses patients can afford, as they resort to <<artisanal>> or <<rustic>> systems that hamper their adaptation process. We present herein the case of a 47 year-old female patient, housewife, with bilateral paresthesias and phantom limb sensation associated with amputation neuromas resulting from type II diabetes mellitus that had affected the patient for eight years. This patient of a low socioeconomic stratum underwent a post-amputation assessment and was diagnosed as being heavily dependent when performing activities of daily living and required assisted wheelchair for ambulation. This is a frequent variant resulting from bilateral loss of lower limbs together with complete loss of vision. We describe the rehabilitation therapy during the pre- and post-prosthetic stages, together with the results of the assessments to show the effectiveness of the treatment process, without forgetting the participation of the caregiver as a fundamental co-therapeutic element in this process.",0,1431
1769,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare demyelinating disease (prevalence 1:40 000), also called arylsulfatase A deficiency (ARS-A), which may present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Clinical assessment may be difficult, due to unspecific signs and symptoms. A case is presented of a 16 year-old female patient seen in psychiatry due to behavioural changes, psychosis, and with impaired overall performance. She was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia, but the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) scan and laboratory tests lead to the diagnosis of MLD.",0,569
1770,"Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Motor Neuron Disease (MND) may share similar pathogenic mechanisms. An abnormal hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic abnormality of these conditions and explains their concurrence in the same family. We report a 77-year-old female presenting with non-fluent aphasia leading to mutism and a mild Parkinsonism. A magnetic resonance imaging showed a severe atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes. Several family members of the patient suffered of atypical Parkinsonism, lateral amyotrophic sclerosis and dementia. We identified an abnormal hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene in the proband. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first time that this diagnosis is confirmed in our country. The knowledge of the genetic basis of neuro degenerative disorders improves diagnosis and opens expectatives for future treatments of these disabling conditions.",0,927
1771,"We present the case of an adult patient with drug-resistant epilepsy caused by extensive inflammation in the right cerebral hemisphere. She was scheduled to undergo right functional hemispherectomy, which is common in pediatric surgery, but about which few studies have been published with respect to adult patients. During the intraoperative period, the density spectral array of the bilateral bispectral index (BIS) VISTA(TM) monitoring system was used. We observed a power increase in low frequency (0.1-4Hz) and alpha bands (8-12Hz) in the right hemisphere, where the epileptogenic focus was. During disconnection from the frontal lobe, there was a marked decrease of power in low frequency and alpha bands on the right side, with no changes during disconnection from other areas of the brain. We think that further studies are needed to determine whether the density spectral array can be a useful tool for monitoring the effectiveness of functional hemispherectomy.",0,971
1772,"BACKGROUND: Caecal bascule is an infrequent type of caecal volvulus. It appears when the caecum folds upon itself, causing an intestinal obstruction. It is usually diagnosed using imaging techniques or intra-operatively. A constrictive band related to previous abdominal surgery is frequently present, and acts as an inflexion point that results in a closed loop obstruction of the ascending colon. It has been reported in young women and in elderly hospitalised patients. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical features, diagnostic difficulties, and management strategies of this unusual entity. CLINICAL CASE: An 83-year-old male with concurrent acute neurological illness presented with history of intestinal obstruction. Because of a previous right nephrectomy, postoperative adhesions were suspected and conservative treatment initiated. As no improvement was seen, a computed tomography scan was obtained. Abdominal tomography showed an intestinal obstruction and a caecal bascule with vascular compromise. A right colectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Caecal bascule is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. The suspicion should be heightened when caecal ectopic dilation is present. Computed tomography scan is the preferred imaging technique, especially for ill patients. Right colectomy and primary anastomosis is the most appropriate surgical technique. Awareness of this entity can prevent the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition.",0,1473
1773,"The case of a 59-year-old female born in Buenos Aires (Argentina) is presented. She had been diagnosed with HIV in 2007 and received highly active antiretroviral therapy until 2011; she also suffered from diabetes type 2. She had received empirical treatment (pyrimethamine-clindamycin) for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Fifteen days later she suffered a drug-induced skin disorder and was treated in the Dermatology Service of the Hospital Muniz with corticosteroids. After five weeks she was readmitted to the Infectious Disease Unit due to asthenia, weight loss, left hip pain and weakness in all four limbs. Septic arthritis and aseptic hip necrosis were ruled out. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The patient received intravenous antibiotics, but before being discharged Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from blood, catheter and urine cultures, and a new series of antibiotics were prescribed. On the 3rd day she presented encephalic facies, changes of behaviour and disorientation, without nuchal rigidity, Kernig and Brudzinski signs or focal signs. An X-ray computed tomography did not show parenchymal lesions. A yeast identified as Candida albicans was isolated in a cerebrospinal fluid culture. The same yeast was recovered in a new cerebrospinal fluid sample. The isolate was susceptible to amphotericin B and susceptible dose dependent to fluconazole. The patient was treated with amphotericin B (0.7mg/kg plus 800mg fluconazole daily). Three weeks later, new cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. Unfortunately, the patient died soon afterwards.",0,1608
1774,"Autoimmune pancreatitis is uncommon, responds to steroids and is usually associated with diabetes mellitus. We report a 73 year-old male who, two months after a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, presented with obstructive jaundice and weight loss. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of an autoimmune pancreatitis and serum IgG4 was 339 mg/dl (normal range 3-201). The patient was treated with prednisone 40 mg/day with a good clinical and laboratory response. During outpatient care, the dose of prednisone was tapered.",0,534
1775,"Accidental ingestion of foreign bodies in childhood is a common event that rarely requires interventional management and presents very few complications involving surgical treatment. We present a clinical case of a 10 month old infant, without abdominal manifestations, in whom it was incidentally found a foreign radiopaque body of 7 cm in length in the abdomen, compatible with a screw. It was not possible to extract it by endoscopy. Therefore, it was necessary to perform surgery and a perforation of the second and third portion of the duodenum was encountered.",0,566
1776,"INTRODUCTION: Rhabdomyolysis is a rare paediatric condition. The case is presented of a patient in whom this developed secondary to severe hypernatraemic dehydration following acute diarrhoea. CASE REPORT: Infant 11 months of age who presented with vomiting, fever, diarrhoea and anuria for 15 hours. Parents reported adequate preparation of artificial formula and oral rehydration solution. He was admitted with malaise, severe dehydration signs and symptoms, cyanosis, and low reactivity. The laboratory tests highlighted severe metabolic acidosis, hypernatraemia and pre-renal kidney failure (Sodium [Na] plasma 181 mEq/L, urine density> 1030). He was managed in Intensive Care Unit with gradual clinical and renal function improvement. On the third day, slight axial hypotonia and elevated cell lysis enzymes (creatine phosphokinase 75,076 IU/L) were observed, interpreted as rhabdomyolysis. He was treated with intravenous rehydration up to 1.5 times the basal requirements, and he showed a good clinical and biochemical response, being discharged 12 days after admission without motor sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypernatraemia is described as a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. In critically ill patients, it is important to have a high index of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis and performing serial determinations of creatine phosphokinase for early detection and treatment.",0,1396
1777,"We present the case of a middle-aged woman with antecedents of cholecystectomy and several episodes of resi-dual coledocolitiasis resolved endoscopically. She attended Emergency Services due to a new clinical picture of abdo-minal pain and alteration of hepatic enzymes. Image tests showed lesions that suggested hepatic abscesses without ruling out a malign origin. Given this doubt it was decided to carry out a thick needle biopsy obtaining a diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumour of the liver related to IgG4-related disease. This is an infrequent entity but must be taken into consideration because - unlike malign pathology, which is the main differential diagnosis - its behaviour is benign, with a good evolution with medical treatment. That is why a suitable diagnosis is vital to avoid aggressive, diagnostic-therapeutic procedures.",0,846
1778,"BACKGROUND: The non-lethal variant of the Escobar or multiple pterygium syndrome is an entity of autosomal recessive inheritance linked to the X chromosome; it is characterized by multiple pterygia (hence its name) located mainly in the neck (95%) and armpits (55%), as well as other orthopedic malformations such as a vertical talus, congenital hip dislocation, and congenital scoliosis. OBJECTIVE: To present an optional surgical technique for the management of severe spinal deformities. CASE REPORT: Twelve-year-old female diagnosed with Escobar syndrome with severe scoliosis which conditions malformations of the chest with lung involvement, producing mechanical ventilatory restriction and increasing the risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection. We performed a hands-free posterior instrumentation with PASS LP system and Smith-Petersen osteotomies. CONCLUSIONS: The Cobb angle improved from 62 degrees to 23 degrees and the sagittal balance from 125 mm to 73 mm.",0,979
1779,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare condition that usually causes a coronary syndrome, but may also cause sudden death. It is more common in women and is associated with factors such as the peripartum period and oral contraceptive use. We report two cases. A 45-year-old woman with hepatitis C, presenting in the emergency room with angina. An intravascular ultrasound showed a dissecting hematoma involving the left, anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. She was initially managed with nitroglycerin, anticoagulation and anti-platelet drugs but due to persistence of symptoms, she required surgical revascularization. A 32-year-old woman presenting in the emergency room with angina. A coronary angiogram revealed a dissection of the anterior descending coronary artery. Eight days later an intravenous ultrasound showed a retrograde progression of the dissection and she was subjected to a surgical revascularization.",0,948
1780,"Two patients, returning to the Netherlands from pilgrimage in Medina and Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, were diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in May 2014. The source and mode of transmission have not yet been determined. Hospital-acquired infection and community-acquired infection are both possible.",1,349
1781,"Spontaneous hepatic rupture during labour is a rare condition. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing hepatic rupture in pregnant women, it is often associated with a high mortality rate. Although pregnant women with HELLP syndrome are more prone to hepatic rupture, it can also occur with other liver pathologies and even in healthy women. We should be vigilant in case of suspicious clinical signs even if we have no evidence of preeclampsia. An early diagnosis will be the key to reducing the mortality and morbidity rate.",0,526
1782,"INTRODUCTION: Polychromatic corneal dystrophy is an unusual pre-descemet dystrophy, about which there are very few publications. The findings are presented in a case series of four patients with polychromatic corneal dystrophy, using a slit lamp, specular biomicroscopy, and confocal microcospy. CLINICAL CASES: Four women, between 36 and 72 year-old, with the diagnosis of polychromatic corneal dystrophy in routine reviews. None reported visual symptoms or ocular history of interest. Anterior biomicroscopy showed multiple and small multicoloured brilliant opacities in the posterior area of the corneal stroma, with normal epithelium and anterior stroma. The opacities were bilateral and distributed throughout the entire cornea. Direct family members were examined, but none of them showed opacities. In the specular biomicroscopy, a normal endothelium, with pre-descemet hypereflective particles, was observed. With confocal microscopy, there were no abnormalities in epithelium, Bowman layer, or sub-basal nervous plexus. In two cases, the anterior stroma showed hyper-reflective keratocytes and with small hypereflective particles among them. In the middle stroma, hyper-reflective keratocytes were seen in the four cases, two of them showed tiny hypereflective particles, and in the other two there were abnormal keratocytes with prominent cytoplasmic processes. Posterior stroma in the four cases showed a lot of hypereflective keratocytes and hypereflective particles of different sizes. These particles prevented examining the endothelium. CONCLUSIONS: Polychromatic corneal dystrophy has typical signs that allow it to be diagnosed and characterised. Although the biomicroscopy image only seems to show alterations in the posterior stroma, confocal microscopy shows that the dystrophy affects the entire corneal stroma.",0,1832
1783,"Central venous catheterization is a very common technique, although its complications can be multiple and sometimes fatal. A case is presented of cardiac tamponade by parenteral nutrition a few hours after moving a central venous catheter peripherally inserted a few days before. The diagnosis was made by echocardiography, and an emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, achieving complete recovery of the patient. Peripherally inserted central venous catheters are more likely to change their position secondary to the movements of the patient's arm, thus it is important to use soft catheters, make sure the tip lies above the carina to avoid perforation of the pericardial reflexion, and fix it well to the skin. Diagnosis must be made as soon as possible, given the high mortality rate of this complication, and the essential diagnostic tool is echocardiography. Elective treatment consists of early catheter withdrawal and emergency pericardiocentesis.",0,961
1784,"Posterior lumbar screw fixation is a common surgical procedure nowadays. However, it can sometimes produce complications that can be devastating. One of the less common causes of major complication is the misplacement of a pedicle screw. This highlights the importance of being methodical when placing pedicle screws, and checking that the pathway has been created correctly and their placement. We present a case of a massive bleed after a pedicular screw placement during lumbar canal stenosis surgery. Screw malposition led to intraoperative haemodynamic instability after failed attempts to control bleeding in the surgical site. Contrast enhanced CT imaging revealed a lumbar intersegmentary artery injury that was eventually controlled by means of a coil embolisation.",0,774
1786,A 50 year old woman was diagnosed with pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) in the right eye and pigmentary glaucoma in the left eye in a routine medical examination. A line of pigment was observed in the vitreo-lenticular interface (Scheie's line) of the left eye and with an intraocular pressure of 26mmHg. The Scheie's line (SL) develops by the accumulation of detached iris pigment in PDS and accumulated in the ligament of Wieger that forms the vitreo-lenticular union. The SL is considered a pathognomonic sign of PDS.,0,521
1787,"Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an extremely rare autosomal recessively inherited glycine encephalopathy caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system, which leads to severe clinical symptoms. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is characterized by complex and diverse phenotypes, such as hypotonia, seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and myoclonic jerks that may lead to apnea and even death. Here we report a 1-year-old boy with myoclonic seizures, hypotonia and coma; he had elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid glycine levels, and cerebrospinal fluid/plasma glycine ratio was 0.24. Two novel heterozygous mutations confirm the diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. One is a missense mutation c.2516A>G (p.Y839C) and the other one is a splicing mutation c.2457+2T>A in the GLDC gene.",0,821
1788,"BACKGROUND: Intramuscular myxoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumour of mesenchymal origin, which appears as a painless mass of slow growth. Early diagnosis is important in order to differentiate it from other entities, especially soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL CASES: Two cases, both women with a mean age of 52.5 years (range 40-65) are presented. The first was seen due to growth of a gluteal mass, and the second by coccydynia. Computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance were the diagnostic tests of choice. In one case, where there was a single but large lesion, radical extirpation of the gluteal muscle was chosen. In the other case, in which the lesions were multiple, individualised excision of cysts was performed. Postoperative functional limitation was low in both types of surgery, with good oncological results being obtained. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular myxomas are benign lesions. There are no cases of malignancy or recurrence due to incomplete resection. It has to be determined whether they are single or multiple, since in the latter case, they could be due to syndromes such as Mazabraud syndrome, which is associated with bone fibrous dysplasia, or Albright syndrome that is also associated with pigmented skin spots.",0,1244
1789,There are no evidence-based guidelines about prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in inflammatory bowel disease. We report a case of P. jiroveci pneumonia in patient with Crohn's disease receiving infliximab and methotrexate. This case emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of this infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated on biological therapy.,0,395
1790,"CLINICAL CASE: A five-year-old patient, with a diagnosis of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, was referred for an ophthalmological examination. He had a history of acute metabolic crises precipitated by intercurrent infections,as well as rhabdomyolysis. The fundoscopic examination revealed a peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy and a diffuse granular appearance of the macular retinal pigment epithelium. Best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes, and he had a normal electroretinography test. DISCUSSION: We perform a review of the literature and recent findings in relation to this disease through the description of a clinical case in order to improve the knowledge of this uncommon disorder.",0,725
1791,CLINICAL CASE: A 46 year old patient presented with visual loss in the left eye during the previous months. Ophthalmoscopic examination and magnetic resonance angiography found the presence of papilledema due to thrombosis in superior sagittal sinus. The examination findings revealed a mantle cell lymphoma. DISCUSSION: Cerebral venous thrombosis is an unusual cause of papilledema. This type of thrombosis may be secondary to hyper-viscosity within a context of a paraneoplastic syndrome.,0,490
1792,"Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. Main interventions to reduce the impact are aimed to enhance prevention and early detection. Results of several studies show that tests such as the fecal occult blood test and colonoscopy are effective for early diagnosis. There are hereditary syndromes such as Lynch Syndrome that can lead to certain types of cancers, including bowel neoplasms, therefore early detection needs to be included as part of the treatment. In these cases, family genetic testing is recommended if the bowel cancer is diagnosed before 50 years old. A care plan including the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association), NOC (Nursing Outcomes Classification) and NIC (Nursing Interventions Classification) was developed for a patient with suspected Lynch Syndrome. Nurses should be qualified to identify potential cases of cancer associated with this syndrome, and thus, reduce the likelihood that family members develop the disease, through genetic counseling and education of environmental risk factors.",0,1071
1793,"Methemoglobinemia is a condition characterized by a high blood concentration of methemoglobin. Methemoglobinemia is a disorder that occurs when hemoglobin in the blood is oxidized to form methemoglobin, rendering it unable to transport oxygen. Although it can be congenital in cyanotic newborn, it is more often an adverse medication effect. The aim is to report a pediatric methemoglobinemia case, assisted in Magdalena V. de Martinez Hospital, with cyanosis in face and limb, in poor condition, that consumed dapsone accidentally. Her methemoglobin concentration was 35%. Intravenous methylene blue was administered with favorable outcome.",0,641
1794,"INTRODUCTION: Stargardt's disease is the most frequent form of inherited macular dystrophy in children and adults. It is a genetic eye disorder caused by mutations in ABCA4 gene with an autosomal recessive inheritance. ABCA4 is a very polymorphic and large gene containing 50 exons. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) can be used for the genetic diagnosis of this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A report is presented on two patients with a clinical diagnosis of Stargardt's disease whose genetic confirmation was performed by a NGS panel of 298 genes. RESULTS: Clinically, the patients showed bull's eye maculopathy and absence of flecks, and genetically they shared the Gly1961Glu mutation that could explain their common phenotype, together with c.C3056T:p.T1019M for case 1, and c.287del:p.Asn96Thrfs*19 for case 2. CONCLUSIONS: NGS is particularly useful in the diagnosis of Stargardt's disease as ABCA4 is a large gene with a high allelic heterogeneity that causes a wide range of clinical manifestations.",0,1027
1795,"Symptomatic posttraumatic arthritis of the elbow in young patients is a disorder for which there is currently no satisfactory solution. In this case report we show the evolution of a comminuted fracture of the capitellum with trochlear extension (McKee typeIV) treated initially with open reduction and internal fixation that eventually required a resurfacing hemiarthroplasty of the capitellum and reconstruction of the lateral ligament complex. After this surgical procedure, the patient had evident improvement of pain and of elbow range of motion, keeping the possibility of performing other rescue techniques open if they were to be necessary in the future.",0,662
1796,"Haglund's syndrome produces posterior impingement of the heel, which is caused by a posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis, known as Haglund's deformity, associated with Achilles tendinitis and retrocalcaneal bursitis. Its pathogenesis is unknown. We report two cases that were diagnosed clinically and confirmed radiographically. One patient was treated conservatively and the other underwent surgery. The diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiological images, using the measurement of the parallel pitch lines, in a lateral radiograph of the ankle. Initial treatment is usually conservative and includes anti-inflammatory or analgesic agents, physiotherapy and low-heeled, open-heeled shoes. If conservative treatment does not relieve the pain, surgery may be necessary.",0,776
1797,"Pituitary diseases such as acromegaly and Cushing's disease require surgical or medical therapy. In some functioning pituitary tumors, a spontaneous remission of hormonal hypersecretion is observed, mainly associated to apoplexy or pituitary infarction. We report the evolution of two female patients older than 70 years at the time of diagnosis, with multiple comorbidities. In case 1, acromegaly was diagnosed at 74 years of age. Sellar CT scan showed a 10-mm adenoma. During her follow-up, IGF1 levels remained normal. Nine years later, a magnetic resonance (MR) showed a 7-mm adenoma. In case 2, clinical and biochemical diagnosis of Cushing's disease was done being 71 years old. Sellar MR showed a 6-mm adenoma. Three years later, urinary cortisol normalized with no changes in adenoma at MR. Seven years later, she remains without clinical or biochemical signs of hypercortisolism. In both cases, no signs of hemorrhage were observed at MR.",0,947
1798,"BACKGROUND: Foreign body ingestion is the second cause of endoscopic emergency in the elderly, and dentures are the most frequent accidently ingested objects. Once in the stomach, their expulsion can be expected in 4 to 6 days. The treatment is wait and see in asymptomatic patients, but preventive endoscopic removal can also be performed. OBJECTIVE: To present 2 scenarios of the outcome and treatment in patients with foreign body ingestion. CASE REPORT: Patient under study due to weight loss, with a denture detected by abdominal x-ray, ingested inadvertently a year ago. A laparotomy was required as extraction by colonoscopy failed, due to excessive inflammation. The second case, of 24-hour onset, was due to the ingestion of a partial denture. As duodenal endoscopy extraction was unsuccessful, the patient was kept under observation. When it did not pass the caecum, it was extracted by colonoscopy, with no further complications and shorter hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up can be by simple abdominal x-ray, with endoscopic management if there is insufficient progress. In one of our cases, the outcome was unfavourable due to time of ingestion, and endoscopic management was not possible, whereas in the second case colonoscopy was performed early with success. Proper diagnostic and timely treatment mark the difference in the progression and outcome of the ingestion of foreign bodies.",0,1404
1799,"Isolated anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly, and few cases have been reported in the pediatric age group. Here in, we report an asymptomatic case of a 2-month-old male infant who has been diagnosed as anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery during the evaluation for cardiac abnormalities. For a suspicion on echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography performed to verify the diagnosis of anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery. The patient underwent surgery and did well after two months follow up. Early diagnosis may prevent patients from cardiovascular complications.",0,741
1800,"We present a patient with a complex clinical picture of primary hyperparathyroidism with multiple destructive skeletal lesions suspicious of bone metastases and concomitant multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma with a metastatic central lymph node. He presented with progressively worsening right hip pain and restricted motion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lytic lesions involving predominantly the right trochanter minor and the left inferior and posterior pubic rami. Biochemical tests were consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. Neck ultrasound and parathyroid scintigraphy revealed a single parathyroid adenoma and a thyroid nodule, preoperative cytology of which confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma, as did the final surgical specimen. Biochemical results, regarding hyperparathyroidism, declined to normal levels and his complaints gradually decreased after surgery. Postoperative whole body bone scintigraphy showed increased tracer uptakes at multiple sites, but they were proved to be metabolically inactive by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography.",0,1114
1801,"With the objective of molecularly characterizing rickettsial isolates from humans with non-specific acute febrile syndrome, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted, with isolates propagated in Vero ATCC cellular cultures and alternative lines, verifying the viability by means of Indirect Immunofluorescence. Prior to DNA extraction, the gltA gene was amplified by means of conventional PCR, and its sequence was analyzed. Twelve isolates were amplified, five with sufficient DNA so as to sequence them, exhibiting compatibility with R. asembonensis in four, and a close identity with Coxiella burnetti in one. At least three of seven alternative cellular lines showed significant yield in sub-cultures. R. asembonensis was identified in four isolates of humans with non-specific acute febrile syndrome, coming from the regions of Ayacucho, Cajamarca, and Madre de Dios in Peru, and Coxiella burnetti in one coming from the Loreto region.",0,948
1802,"Cherubism is a rare disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. It is classified as a benign fibro-osseous lesions and may involve either facial bone. Its typical dentofacial deformities are caused by mutations in the SH3BP2 gene. The protein encoded by SH3BP2 had a significant role in the regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Accordingly with the radiological findings, differential diagnoses includes fibrous dysplasia, giant cell granuloma, osteosarcoma, juvenile ossifying fibroma, fibrous osteoma, odontogenic cyst and hyperparathyroidism. The aim of the present report is twofold. First, we examine the importance of the proper management of these cases. Second, we describe this rare syndrome with the goal of proposing suitable treatments.",0,756
1803,"INTRODUCTION: the incidence of invasive infections caused by pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) has declined since generalized vaccination with pneumococcal conjugated vaccine, but it is still a prevalent pathogen in children. Amongst pneumococcal invasive infections, IE (infectious endocarditis) is rare, with an incidence between 1 and 7%. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a previously healthy 4 year old boy, who had received one dose of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine who presents with fever, a new heart murmur and heart failure. Blood cultures were posi tive for penicillin susceptible pneumococcus. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed tricuspid and pulmonary valve vegetations. The patient received 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment for pneumo-coccal IE. He presented secondary valve damage that needed surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IE should be considered as a differential diagnosis of children presenting with fever and a newly diag nosed heart murmur, and pneumococcus as an etiologic agent in non hospitalized febrile patients with severe infections.",0,1087
1804,"CASE REPORTS: The cases concern a 4 year-old boy and 25 year-old female with 20/20 visual acuity, who presented with a unilateral non-pigmented macular lesion, temporal to the fovea, a torpedo shaped defect in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Optical coherence tomography showed attenuation of the RPE signal, and in the second patient there proved to be a neurosensory detachment, RPE atrophy, and thinning of the retinal layers. The lesion was hypoautofluorescent and hyperfluorescent on fluorescein angiography. DISCUSSION: Torpedo maculopathy is an asymptomatic characteristic lesion which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of macular lesions in children and young patients.",0,700
1805,"Tonsil malignancy is uncommon in children. Tonsillar asymmetry is usually secondary to a benign process, either inflammatory conditions, differences in the tonsillar fossa depth or anterior pillar asymmetry. However, it may indicate a serious underlying disorder such as lymphoma. Lymphoma is the most common childhood malignancy in the head and neck. Approximately, 15% of the cases affect the Waldeyer's ring. The most common clinical manifestations of palatine tonsils lymphoma are unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, alteration in the appearance of the mucosa and ipsilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are of great importance in the prognosis. We present a case of palatine tonsil lymphoma in a child with tonsillar asymmetry and we emphasize the importance of the examination of the oral cavity and the neck to identify suspicious alterations compatible with tonsillar lymphoma.",0,923
1806,"BACKGROUND: Deaths due to tuberculosis have reached 2.5 million cases per year worldwide. Poncet's disease is an infrequent form of tuberculosis characterised by a clinical picture of polyarthritis. CLINICAL CASE: A 24-year-old male presented with morning stiffness, arthralgias, bilateral symmetric arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, knees, ankles, and shoulders, and adenomegalies at the cervical, submandibular, left supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal levels, without fever. Laboratory results were as follows: ESR 44mm/h, C-reactive protein 4.35, normal levels of complement C3 and C4, negative rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, positive antinuclear antibodies with fine speckled pattern (1:320) and cytoplasm (1:160) pattern and negative anti-Smith, -double-stranded DNA, Sjogren's syndrome-antigen A and Sjogren's syndrome-antigen B. Histological report of cervical node tissue revealed granulomatous lesions compatible with tuberculosis. Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus were ruled out. Anti-tuberculosis agents were initiated that resolved the clinical picture. Diagnosis of Poncet's disease was confirmed. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis between tuberculosis and autoimmune inflammatory joint diseases is a clinical challenge.",0,1323
1807,"Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare, commonly benign, congenital, localized or generalized vascular anomaly of unknown aetiology. It is characterized by persistent cutis marmorata, telangiectasia and phlebectasia. Extracutaneous findings may be associated with CMTC in 18.8-70% of the cases. Diagnosis of the disorder is based on the clinical findings. The prognosis is good and improvement is observed within 2 years after birth. Herein, we report a case of a male neonate with CMTC presented on the skin of all his limbs, trunk and face, and an associated anomaly including syndactyly. We present this case because of its rarity.",0,654
1808,"BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas secondary to gunshot wounds have been increasing due to military activities, with endovascular treatment showing better results in haemodynamically stable patients. CLINICAL CASE: A 16 year-old male with diagnosis of femoral arteriovenous fistula in the left lower extremity was admitted to general surgery for endovascular management. A procedure with stent was performed without complications, and is currently on anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment. CONCLUSION: Arteriovenous fistulas under the inguinal region can be safely treated with endovascular treatment (embolisation or stent) on stable patients. The objective of this therapy is to close the defect between artery and vein. This is the case of a patient with great results due to endovascular treatment, decreasing complications of the surgical treatment.",0,857
1809,"Since 1968, many surgical techniques used in repairing the pars defect of the vertebra have been reported. Technological advances are giving rise to new ways of obtaining the best outcome using less invasive methods, which are more accurate, simple and effective. To treat cases of spondylolysis such as pseudarthrosis, we used neuro-navigation and microscopy through a 2.5-cm skin incision to approach the pars defect, freshen the fracture and place a type of screw that, until now, has never been used for this purpose. This is a novel technique, which guarantees prolonged compression and sufficient stability to facilitate the prompt healing of the vertebra. We present 2 cases of L5 spondylolysis treated with our technique, a modification of Buck's technique. A detailed description of the screw selection, surgical technical details, follow-up and outcome are discussed.",0,877
1810,"The current increasing use of decompressive craniectomy carries the implicit appearance of complications due to alterations in both intracranial pressure and in the hydrostatic-hemodynamic equilibrium. Paradoxical transtentorial herniation represents a rare manifestation, included in ""trephine syndrome"", extremely critical but with relatively simple treatment. We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with no interesting medical history, who, after an olfactory groove meningioma surgery, presented a haemorrhage located in the surgical area with an important oedema. The patient required a second emergency surgery without any chance of conserving the cranial vault. During the post-operational period, great neurological deterioration in orthostatic position was noticed, which resolved spontaneously in decubitus. This deficit was resolved with bone replacement afterwards. We discuss possible predisposing factors and aetiologies of this pathology.",0,957
1811,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented on a 54-year-old woman with a central serous chorioretinopathy, misdiagnosed as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and treated with systemic corticosteroids. The patient presented with a bilateral bullous exudative retinal detachment. DISCUSSION: Discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy, surgical drainage of subretinal fluid, and photodynamic therapy, led to anatomical and functional improvement. The recognition of an atypical presentation of central serous chorioretinopathy may avoid complications of the inappropriate treatment with corticosteroids.",0,587
1812,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a lethal entity, characterized by extensive epidermal necrosis and multiorgan failure. Hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS) is also a rare and lethal syndrome characterized by hyperinflammation that leads to the appearance of fever, pancytopenia, organomegaly and hemophagocytosis. The concomitance of these diseases is extremely uncommon. We report a 38 years old female, who during the course of a HFS secondary to Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), presented a TEN secondary to antibiotics. She was admitted due to a consumptive syndrome, lymphadenopathy, visceromegaly and severe pancytopenia. Laboratory and bone marrow tests confirmed HFS. Due to constant fever, imipenem was indicated. On the third day she started with pain and skin rash. She evolved with positive Nikolsky sign. Cutaneous biopsy was concordant with extensive TEN, which was managed with intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone. A complete response and normalization of the blood count were achieved. Finally, the lymph node biopsy showed HL of mixed cellularity type, which was managed with 8 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy, achieving complete remission.",0,1149
1813,"CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns a 78 year-old woman with a history of XEN((R)) surgery, in whom a conjunctival perforation was observed at the implant level at 18-months of follow-up, for which surgical intervention was decided. During surgery a short subconjunctival portion was found (0.5mm). An unsuccessful attempt was made to extract it by traction, but the XEN((R)) broke easily. Finally, it was decided to cut it to scleral level, and suture the conjunctiva. During the first week there was a decrease in intraocular pressure (6mmHg), to subsequently increase to 25, and deciding to start medical treatment. DISCUSSION: Conjunctival exposure of the XEN((R)) stent is a rare but potentially serious complication. To avoid it, a meticulous surgical technique is important when implanting it. If this occurs, it is important to identify the cause. If it is due to a short subconjunctival portion, a therapeutic alternative is to cut the implant at this level to avoid further complications.",0,995
1814,"BACKGROUND: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma is a rare primary hepatic tumour, showing both hepatocellular as well as biliary epithelium differentiation. Its diagnosis is often delayed, as it occurs in young patients without comorbidities and with non-specific symptoms. Most cases are confused with other types of cancer, especially fibrolamellar liver cancer, which is more frequent and has similar clinical and radiological features. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 26 year old woman with a giant combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with difficulties in its diagnosis and a complicated surgical approach. DISCUSSION: The definitive diagnosis of this disease is defined by the histological demonstration of cholangiolar and hepatocellular differentiation, with surgical treatment always being the best choice, but with lower survival than classic hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. In some patients with unfavourable prognostic factors, adjuvant chemotherapy mainly directed cholangiolar component can be given. CONCLUSION: The current incidence of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma varies from 2 to 5% of cases, and is one of the rarest histological types in the world. The large size and hypervascularisation of the tumour makes a surgical approach difficult in these patients, while the rare histological features require a more detailed study of the piece and the application of immunohistochemical techniques to confirm the diagnosis.",0,1491
1815,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was a great global concern in 2014. It has a wide range of manifestations that may differ in each area as well as high mortality. In this study, we report the epidemiological characteristics, history, clinical, and paraclinical information of all 5 patients from Iran with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV. All patients were from Kerman province. None of them had a history of travel, contact with animals, or consumption of camel milk products, however, all of the patients had contact with a person who had been in Saudi-Arabia and experienced respiratory infection. One of the 5 patients was a man and 2 passed away from the disease. Fever and respiratory symptoms were the most common symptoms, and 2 patients had watery diarrhea. Alveolar patterns were observed in all available chest radiograms, and 3 patients had elevated liver aminotransferase levels. Two of these patients had leukopenia, and none had renal failure. In conclusion, the results of this study underscore the need for all patients with acute respiratory symptoms with contact with a person who has recently traveled to Saudi-Arabia and experienced respiratory infection to be investigated for MERS-CoV.",1,1233
1816,"Among autoimmune encephalitides, a prevalent group are those associated with antibodies against the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which present with behavior abnormalities, psychosis, seizures and abnormal movements. A new variant, mediated by antibodies against the GABA-A receptor, was recen-tly described. We report a 66-years-old female with this form of encephalitis whose main manifestation was the presence of severe seizures leading to status epilepticus. The patient had a good response to immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, azathioprine and anticonvulsants. The laboratory tests initially detected anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies which lead to the misdiagnosis of Hashimoto Encephalitis, which was ruled out after the detection of antibodies against GABA-A receptor. No malignancy was detected.",0,835
1817,"Liver involvement occurs in 0.2 to 3% of patients with syphilis. We report three patients with liver involvement in syphilis. A 52-year-old male presenting with erythema and malaise. Laboratory showed a gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) of 853 u/l, alkaline phosphatases of 1,010 U/L and VDRL was positive. Treatment with penicillin resolved the skin problem and normalized liver enzymes. A HIV positive 30-year-old male in peritoneal dialysis presenting with itching, malaise and markedly elevated GGT and alkaline phosphatases. VDRL was positive. He was treated with penicillin with remission of symptoms and enzyme normalization. A 43-year-old male presenting with erythema, malaise, arthralgias and elevated GGT and alkaline phosphatases. VDRL was positive and treatment with penicillin reverted symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.",0,840
1818,"Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is an exotoxin that is produced by many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and an important virulence factor. A PVL-positive S. aureus infection leads to rapid and severe infections of soft tissue and necrotizing pneumonia in healthy adolescents, and has a high mortality. This case report included a 12-year-old male patient who admitted for fever, respiratory distress and hip pain and was identified with necrotizing pneumonia with septic pulmonary embolism, psoas abscess, cellulitis and osteomyelitis. The PVL positive methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) was isolated in the patient blood culture.",0,638
1819,"CLINICAL CASE: A 44-year-old woman arrived in the emergency department complaining of decreased visual acuity (VA) in oculus uterque (OU) of 4hours onset. Signs of myopia, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in OU, and a narrow grade II anterior chamber (AC) were observed. In the posterior segment ultrasound scan, a choroidal peripheral detachment is evident, and a lenticular thickness of 4.05mm is measured in the anterior segment of the right eye (OD) and 4.00mm in the left eye (OS). On treatment with oral with naproxen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), and acetazolamide for migraine. The acetazolamide is suspended and topical treatment is started with timolol and brimonidine every 12hours, with prednisolone and ayclopentolate every 8hours. In the follow-up, a gradual reduction of myopia and lens thickness is observed, as well as anterior chamber expansion. In the last control, the patient had a sphere of -0.75 diopters (D) in OD and -0.25 D in OS. IOP was 15mmHg in OU and AC was grade III. The ultrasound showed a lens thickness of 3.59mm in OD and 3.61mm in OS. CONCLUSION: This was an iatrogenic case of acute angle closure induced by an anterior displacement of the irido-lenticular complex, secondary to the use of acetazolamide. The treatment of this condition involves suspending the drug responsible and applying topical corticosteroids, hypotensive and cycloplegic eye drops, with the aim of lowering the eye pressure and the degree of myopia due to the re-positioning of the irido-lenticular complex.",0,1533
1820,"A clinical case reported to SENSAR is presented (www.sensar.org). A patient came to the operating room for surgery for parathyroidectomy. She had several predictors of difficult airway management, including a story of difficulties in previous intubations in other hospitals, as the patient reported. Therefore, after evaluation in preoperative consultation, fibreoptic bronchoscopy intubation was recommended. The day of surgery after induction of general anesthesia direct laryngoscopy was performed, without recognizing any glottic structure (Cormack-Lehane grade iv). Conventional laryngoscope was changed to a videolaryngoscope (Airtraq((R))) to try to improve the laryngoscopic view, but there were difficulties with handling and insertion of it, causing minor injuries to the lingual mucosa. Finally, tracheal intubation was achieved after several attempts. Analysis of the incident revealed the active error due to lack of experience of the professional who performed intubation maneuvers, favored by latent factors or contributors as were the complex pathology of the patient and the absence of protocols to difficult airway management in the hospital. Communication and analysis of this incident served to highlight the importance of the security protocols in Anesthesia, and as a result a working group that conducted the current algorithm approach to a difficult airway management was formed, established guidelines for further information patient and deals since clinical training and professional practice for the management of airway devices availables in the hospital.",0,1583
1821,"Microsurgical clipping is still regarded as the gold-standard treatment for broad-neck intracranial aneurysms. New endovascular techniques like balloon or stent assisted coiling are quickly rising to the challenge and showing promising outcomes. As a result, broad-neck aneurysms are increasingly addressed by these techniques despite they have not been tested against clipping in a randomized controlled trial and long-term complications might be unknown yet. Intraprocedural coil migration has been well documented in the literature, but the same complication in a delayed fashion is scarcely reported. We present a case of delayed coil migration occurring after a balloon-assisted embolization of a wide-necked intracranial aneurysm and we perform a literature review for similar cases. We discuss how, despite seeming an extremely rare complication, with new endovascular techniques increasingly perceived as the safer option in any aneurysm, potential adverse events may become more frequent. Strategies proposed to address this developing scenario are also reviewed.",0,1072
1822,"The arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane is used in patients with hemodynamic and respiratory failure, unresponsive to conventional treatment. It provides transitory hemodynamic support, oxygenation and removal of CO2, allowing pulmonary rest. Moreover it offers the possibility of ultraprotective ventilation and avoids generation of VILI (Ventilation-Induced Lung Injury). It is not frequently used in patients with hemodynamic failure secondary to obstructive shock due to mediastinal compromise. We present the case of a patient with obstructive shock, mediastinal mass of lymphoproliferative origin that was treated with extracorporeal arteriovenous circulation membrane.",0,677
1823,"Topical negative pressure therapy is an alternative treatment for complex wounds that consists of the direct application of sub-atmospheric pressure, obtaining a number of effects that are beneficial for tissues, promoting the healing of both acute and chronic wounds and complementing surgical procedures. We report the case of a 75 year old man diagnosed with surgical wound dehiscence after a femorotibial bypass graft, who was hospitalized again with the aim to perform the implantation of a topical negative pressure therapy in the infected wound. We designed a care plan for this patient following the steps of the scientific method and basing ourselves on the NANDA, NIC, and NOC taxonomies.",0,698
1824,"CLINICAL CASES: The cases are presented of two patients with periocular basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid who received topical imiquimod 5%, with a good response. Both had a functional state that contraindicated surgical treatment.

1825,"Breast cancer surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or, more recently, combined with conventional regional techniques. Pectoral nerves (PECs) block appears as an analgesic alternative in these procedures, but few studies refer to it as a single anesthetic technique(1-3). In this case report, we describe a 56-year-old female patient, BMI 31kg/m(2), ASA IV, admitted for elective tumorectomy of the left upper quadrant of the breast and sentinel node investigation. Given the multiple comorbidities and the high anesthetic and surgical risk, the anaesthetic plan consisted in ultrasound guided PECs II block as a single anesthetic technique. The authors report a successful anesthetic and pain management without complications in breast surgery. PECs block, as a single anesthetic technique, may be safe, advantageous and effective with haemodynamic stability and few side effects in high risk cardiac patients.",0,927
1826,"Acute myocardial infarction during pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. Coronary atherosclerosis is the most common cause due to an increase in the age of the patients and the association with cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and the existence of family history of coronary disease. However, thrombosis, coronary dissection or coronary vasospasms are other causes that may justify it. We report the case of a 33 weeks pregnant first-time mother, without cardiovascular risk factors, who presented an acute coronary event in the context of atherosclerotic disease and coronary dissection after percutaneous coronary intervention.",0,714
1827,"A 13-year-old female arrived at the Emergency Department with a two-week history of headache, and bilateral papilloedema on examination. The initial study with CT and MRI showed a large multicystic left frontal mass with calcification surrounded by peripheral oedema, subacute intralesional bleeding and association of multiple large vessels. She was initially operated on in another centre where a subacute haematoma was found, evacuating to multiple vessels and arteriolised veins. Despite the earlier neuroimaging findings, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was suspected, so she was referred to our centre for further treatment. We performed angiography, MR angiography and MRI with advanced sequences, diagnosing a highly vascularised intra-axial tumour which was embolised. The patient was then definitively operated on, with the resulting finding of extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN). EVN are extremely rare lesions, not previously described in the literature as hypervascularised lesions, which in our case required prior angiography and embolisation for proper diagnosis and adequate management.",0,1104
1828,"A case of Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, a congenital generalised lipodystrophy, is reported. Symptoms first appeared when the patient was 20 years old. She showed severe insulin resistance as well as micro- and macro-angiopathic complications, including chronic kidney disease, which required renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis. The patient's clinical course was reviewed since paediatric age (when initial signs of the disease being already evident) to present time. Berardinelli-Seip syndrome is very uncommon, and the present case is particularly rare because it is the only case (at least as reported in the literature) in a patient receiving dialysis.",0,670
1829,"INTRODUCTION: ROHHAD syndrome (rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation) is a rare and complex disease, presenting in previously healthy children at the age of 2-4 years. Up to 40% of cases are associated with neural crest tumours. DEVELOPMENT: We present the case of a 2-year-old girl with symptoms of rapidly progressing obesity, who a few months later developed hypothalamic dysfunction with severe electrolyte imbalance, behaviour disorder, hypoventilation, and severe autonomic dysregulation, among other symptoms. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unclear, an autoimmune hypothesis has been proposed for ROHHAD. Therefore, after obtaining a limited response to intravenous immunoglobulins, we decided to test the response to a high dose cyclophosphamide (low dose was not effective either). Unfortunately our patient experienced many severe complications (among them central pontine myelinolysis, from which the patient recovered, and failure to wean from the ventilator requiring tracheostomy and long term ventilation) that required a prolonged ICU stay. Although her behaviour improved, our patient unfortunately died suddenly at home at the age of 5 due to respiratory pathology. CONCLUSIONS: ROHHAD syndrome is a rare and little-known disease which requires a multidisciplinary approach because it involves complex symptoms and multiple organ system involvement. Alveolar hypoventilation should be identified early and appropriate treatment should be started promptly for the best possible outcome. Immunomodulatory treatment with immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab has previously resulted in symptom improvement in some cases. Because of the low incidence of the syndrome, multi-centre studies must be carried out in order to gather more accurate information about ROHHAD pathophysiology and design an appropriate therapeutic approach.",0,1937
1830,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 45 year-old man with a focal choroidal excavation associated with choroidal neovascularisation not included in the area of excavation. Clinical features were analysed using retinography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. The patient was treated with 3 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, with a good response. DISCUSSION: Focal choroidal excavation can be associated with choroidal neovascularization not included in the area of excavation. Multimodal imaging provides a complete description of clinical features, before and after treatment.",0,652
1831,"MYH9 related diseases are caused by mutations in the MYH9 gene and constitute a rare group of genetic entities. Its inheritance follows an autosomal dominant pattern. The MYH9 gene, encodes the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, expressed in different tissues and especially in podocytes and mesangial cells. The disorder is characterized by the presence of macrothrombocytopenia, leukocyte inclusions and a variable risk of developing renal failure, hearing loss and early-onset cataracts. We describe the case of a 27-year-old Caucasian woman, diagnosed initially with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. After a detailed family history and the appearance of renal involvement and hearing loss, genetic testing allowed to make the diagnosis of nephropathy associated with MYH9 mutation. This case is an example of the delayed diagnosis of uncommon diseases and highlights the usefulness genetic testing. A review of the disease is provided.",0,942
1832,"BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of cancer in childhood and adolescence and it is the most common malignant bone tumor in this group of age. Osteosarcoma is frequently found in long bones of the extremities. There are very few cases described in children under 5 years of age, and according to this review, none in infants. The telangiectatic variant is uncommon, and there are no reported cases before preschool age. CASE REPORT: A 10-month-old female infant with a lithic tumor of the ninth right rib, which was classified after resection as a telangiectatic osteosarcoma, is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Telangiectatic osteosarcoma in the pediatric age is very uncommon. To date, the patient has presented good response to treatment, although the prognosis and survival of this condition is unknown.",0,821
1833,"The clinical case is presented on a patient with an extensive sacral dysraphism, a history of myelomeningocele surgical repair in her childhood, as well as tethered cord syndrome. The patient was also diagnosed with pseudomeningocele and a cerebrospinal fluid cutaneous fistula. A surgical approach was used, with encouraging results being obtained in the clinical outcome of the patient. A review of the literature was performed to support the surgical decision in this case.",0,476
1834,"Pneumoperitoneum in children may be due to causes that do not require urgent surgery (cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres, severe respiratory pathology or mechanical ventilation). Surgery in these cases could even worsen the prognosis. We present the case of a male infant, ex-preterm, with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis and ileal perforation at birth, requiring laparotomy and intestinal resection on two occasions and developing a secondary microcolon, due to disuse. At six months, after transitioning to full oral feeding, he presented abdominal distension with extensive intestinal pneumatosis and pneumoperitoneum on radiographs. His general appearance was good with normal intestinal transit and no peritonitis. The patient remained fasting with intravenous antibiotics, nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The evolution was favourable with oral feeding restarting on the seventh day of admission. The existence of pneumoperitoneum does not always require a laparotomy and global assessment of the patient by an interdisciplinary health team may avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments.",0,1123
1835,"BACKGROUND: Cervical lymphangiomas are uncommon benign congenital malformations usually present in children, and are rare in adults. Currently, complete resection is still the standard care. Two cases are presented of a cervical lymphangioma in an adult. The diagnosis and surgical approach is also discussed. CLINICAL CASE: Case 1. The first case is a 23 year old male with chief complaint of a tumour in the posterior triangle of the neck, which showed a substantial increase in size in the last 9 months. No associated signs or symptoms, or any trauma history was reported. CT scan of the neck showed images suggestive of a posterior cervical lymphangioma. Exploratory cervical surgery was performed, with complete resection of a cystic tumour located in the posterior triangle of the neck. Surgery was performed without complications and postoperative care was unremarkable. CASE 2: The second case is a 28 woman with a cystic tumour in submandibular space. She had history of a previous incomplete operation in another institution 2 years ago, with recurrence of the tumour. A second surgery was performed with complete resection without complications, and with a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical lymphangioma is a very rare benign disease, surgical treatment is preferred, but sclerotherapy can be used as alternative treatment.",0,1337
1836,"We report a 23-year-old woman, with three recent exertional syncopes. Transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography found a large heterogeneous mass (38 x 35 mm) arising from the posterior mitral annulus, protruding in systole through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Heart MRI confirmed the echocardiography findings, suggesting a cardiac myxoma. Cardiac surgery accomplished the complete resection of the lesion, confirming a mass arising from the posterior mitral annulus and preserving mitral anatomy and function. Pathology was positive for a myxoma. Uneventful evolution allowed the discharge of the patient at the fifth postoperative day. Control TTE discarded any complication.",0,712
1837,"Tuberculosis, considered since 2003 by the World Health Organization a global health emergency, causes annual mortality of approximately 2 million people, mainly in developing countries. In the Spanish pediatric population, the incidence is 5 cases/100 000 children between 5 and 14 years and 13 cases/100 000 children between 0 and 4 years. The infection is transmitted through the respiratory tract by baciliferous patients. Children eliminate few bacilli in respiratory secretions and do not usually transmit the infection. In Spain, the resistance to isoniazid in the general population is 5%, being higher in the immigrant population, which is important to take into account for the treatment of cases. A case of tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium africanum multiresistant to treatment is presented, with satisfactory evolution after multiple therapy.",0,855
1838,"INTRODUCTION: Fabry's disease is an infrequent metabolic pathology linked to the X chromosome which causes a wide variety of signs and symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old male who was admitted to our stroke unit with right-side hemiparesis (1 + 0) and dysarthria (1). The score on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was 2. The patient presented angiokeratomas in both thighs. A computerised axial tomography scan of the head showed left thalamic acute infarction. The duplex scan of the supra-aortic trunks was normal, and the transcranial Doppler reflected a generalised increase in the pulsatility indices. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilatation. He was discharged five days later, with antiaggregating medication but asymptomatic. The prolonged Holter-electrocardiogram recording showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. One notable value in the urine analysis was microalbuminuria of 281 mg/L. In view of the multi-organic involvement and the family history, a study for Fabry's disease was performed. Activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A was diminished, and the presence of a mutation in the GLA gene was found. The patient's brother, who suffered from kidney failure and atrial fibrillation, was positive for this mutation. The patient is on treatment with agalsidase beta. CONCLUSIONS: Fabry's disease must be suspected in young males with heart disease, stroke or peripheral neuropathy, skin lesions, kidney failure and a history of cases in the family. Hormone replacement therapy must be established at an early stage, as it can improve the prognosis.",0,1634
1839,"Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor. It is characterized by osteoid production by tumor cells. Its most frequent location is in the metaphyses of long bones, but a purely diaphyseal presentation is reported in 10% of cases. We report the case of a female 25 year-old patient whose symptoms of pain and swelling of the right mid thigh started four months before, without an apparent cause. Femur X-rays showed a tumor in the femoral shaft. The MRI showed extension to soft tissues with no compromise of the neurovascular bundle. The histopathologic report of the incisional biopsy was osteoblastic and chondroblastic osteosarcoma, classified as Enneking IIB, AJCC IIB. Treatment consisted of three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Then intercalary femur resection plus reconstruction with centromedullary nailing and a diaphyseal spacer were performed. The histopathologic report was 95% necrosis (Huvos grade III). Three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were given and now, 18 months after completing the latter, the patient has no signs of local or distant tumor activity, and she can walk unassisted. Despite the fact that osteosarcoma does not occur usually in the mid shaft of long bones, we should always bear it in mind as part of the differential diagnosis for other conditions that occur more frequently in that region. Such location allows for a broad gamut of surgical approaches that spare the adjacent joints.",0,1450
1840,"From 2003 to date there has been a rising number of reports from developed countries on cases of lymphogranuloma venereum with anorectal localization in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. This localization differs from the classical inguinal abscesses which are typical of the disease in the tropics. The objective of this work is to document the presence of anorectal lymphogranuloma venereum in Buenos Aires and to describe its varied clinical manifestations. In the context of a systematic survey of rectal chlamydial infection, in just one trimester, eight cases of lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis biovar LGV were identified in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. The most frequent anorectal manifestations were pus, tenesmus, rectal urgency, and mucous or haemopurulent discharge. The proctitis was mostly mild or moderate and, in some cases, it was accompanied by perianal lesions. Given the great polymorphism and unspecificity of the clinical manifestations of the disease, we warn on the presence of this form of rectal lymphogranuloma venereum in our setting. If Chlamydia trachomatis is detected, it should be genotyped, not only for the correct diagnosis and treatment but also for epidemiological surveillance. Where genotyping is not available, the disease must be considered as caused by the LGV biovar and treated accordingly.",0,1376
1841,"CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 69-year-old woman with unilateral retinal vasculitis. Investigations showed asthma, rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, peripheral blood eosinophilia, increased sedimentation rate, proteinuria, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative. DISCUSSION: Although her anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA) status was negative, taking into account the other clinical and laboratory features, retinal vasculitis was thought to be an ocular manifestation of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Treatment was started with high-dose corticosteroids and anticoagulant therapy.",0,646
1842,CASE REPORT: We present the case of an 81-year-old man with retinal detachment caused by intrusion of an Arruga suture. The encircling buckle was located in the sub-retinal space and caused retinal breaks with retinal detachment DISCUSSION: A pars plana vitrectomy was performed along with intraocular cutting of the Arruga suture with retinal re-attachment.,0,358
1843,"We report a case of a 41 years old patient complaining of chronic dorsalgia. MRI showed a well defined intradural extramedular dumbbell-shaped lesion, associated to a left paravertebral tumor at D5-D6 level. The tumor was embolizated prior to surgery. Following she underwent a D4-D6 laminotomy, left D5-D6 costotransversectomy and resection of the intracanal extradural part of the lesion with section of the left D5 nerve. Posteriorly, complete resection of the extracanal portion of the tumor was performed by a postero-lateral approach. The anatomopathologic diagnosis was a malignant schwannoma. After the surgery, the patient required adyuvant radiotherapic treatment. Malignant schwannoma is a very uncommon tumor which belongs to the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). It develops from Schwann cells. It is frequently associated with type 1 neurofibromatosis. MPNST usually present local recurrence and can metastatize.",0,942
1844,"BACKGROUND: Infection and instability are the complications of prosthetic shoulder surgery of more difficult management. Instability builds up to half of the cases, while the fungal infection accounts for less than 1% of all and can cause severe damage to bone and soft tissue. METHODS: In this case clinical fungal infection by Candida parapsilosis is presented in a shoulder hemiarthroplasty indicated by a fracture of the proximal humerus. He received surgical treatment in two-stages and administration of fluconazole for eight weeks prior to the second surgical time. In revision surgery was placed a reverse prosthesis as definitive treatment; however, the patient suffered several episodes of dislocation in the postoperative period; a second revision prosthetic surgery was necessary to use more stable components. During this surgery, we extracted samples that were analyzed, obtaining negative results for infection. RESULTS: Now after three years of follow-up, the patient is well, no limitations in their daily work and has a Constant Score of 50.5. DISCUSSION: We report our experience in this exceptional situation. We know, this is one of the first cases where the fungal infection and dislocation prosthetics in the same patient meet. This situation is a challenge for the surgeon, which has to treat complications two practically at the same time; we do not have scientific evidence to establish a criterion unified for the treatment of complications after surgery for revision of arthroplasty of the shoulder, especially in reverse or mega-denture prosthesis.",0,1577
1845,We investigated a case of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) after exposure to infected camels. Analysis of the whole human-derived virus and 15% of the camel-derived virus sequence yielded nucleotide polymorphism signatures suggestive of cross-species transmission. Camels may act as a direct source of human MERS-CoV infection.,1,371
1846,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a heterogeneous clinical and biochemical entity. We present the case of a young male with history of venous thromboembolism. This time he presents because of chest ischemic pain associated with ST segment elevation. He was taken to the cath lab to perform a primary percutaneous coronary intervention and a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was noted. Successful thrombus aspiration was performed. No stent was deployed. He was taken to the cath lab for a second look angiography and no atherosclerotic lesions were observed, which was confirmed by intravascular ultrasound.",0,633
1847,"We report a case of acute-onset multifocal vertebral osteitis with a marked impact on the patient's general health. The radiological, scintigraphic and magnetic resonance findings made it necessary to carry out a differential diagnosis to distinguish it from an infiltrative neoplastic process and determine whether it had an infectious or an inflammatory etiology.

Treatment with infliximab led to improvement in the clinical symptoms, laboratory values and radiological abnormalities.",0,647
1848,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcomatoid carcinoma can occur in any part of the body; in the head and neck it occurs most frequently in the major salivary glands, with only about 1% of cases found in the larynx. As it has both epithelial and mesenchymal components, there are many theories concerning its origin and it can prove a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT: A 76 year old male smoker presented with dysphonia. Vocal cord injury was found on examination but no lymphadenopathy or metastases were present. Laryngeal microsurgery was performed with complete excision of the lesion. Histopathology showed it to be a carcinosarcoma which showed intense and diffuse positivity for vimentin and focal positivity for AE1-AE3, CK5 and p63. The patient underwent radiotherapy as complementary treatment. DISCUSSION: Sarcomatoid carcinoma usually presents with obstructive symptoms such as dysphonia. Prognosis depends on the stage and the presence or not of metastases. Both epithelial markers EMA, cytokeratin (AE1-AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, Ki 67 and mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, desmin, S-100 may be positive in these tumours. Recommended treatment for T2-T1 stages is an excisional biopsy which can be followed by adjuvant radiotherapy; radiotherapy alone has also been successful. T3-T4 stages can be treated with local excision, partial laryngectomy or total laryngectomy with subsequent ganglion emptying and concomitant radio and chemotherapy.",0,1451

It accounts for 0.5%-2% of all fibroadenomas and exact etiology is not known; however, hormonal influences are thought to be contributing factors. We present a case of a 20 cm diameter giant juvenile fibroadenoma of the breast in a 14-year-old girl. The patient was suffering from a painless, progressively enlarging mass for 1 year. Ultrasound revealed fibroadenoma and total surgical excision was performed. The patient is doing well in ten months of follow up.",0,637
1850,CLINICAL CASE: A young woman was referred to our offices with impairment of visual acuity after she received a third tattoo on her arm. Systemic medical and laboratory work-up were performed in order to exclude an infectious agent or inflammatory disease. A yellowish juxtafoveal lesion in left eye along with a plaque-like outer retinal disruption and focal pigmentary defects was assessed using multi-modal diagnostic imaging.

1853,"INTRODUCTION: Bone cystic angiomatosis is a disease with only 200 cases described, based on angiomatous nonmalignant proliferation, in bone tissue and viscera. It focuses on pelvis, long bones and scapular waist. Clinical evolution ranges from self-limiting forms to massive aggressive osteolysis (Gorham-Stout).Its diagnosis is of exclusion, with nonspecific clinical, radiological (lytic images) and histopathological findings. CLINICAL CASE: Our study is based on the clinical case of a 14-year-old man diagnosed with bone cystic angiomatosis, with disseminated bone involvement, who came to our center for pain and functional impotence in the right hip, diagnosing a pertrochanteric fracture. It was operated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with four-hole VERSA sliding plate screw. An allogeneic graft of cancellous bone was used from femoral head. The evolution was satisfactory, with ambulation at full load per month without requiring analgesic medication and control X-ray at eight months that showed signs of complete integration of the graft. The analgesic pain scale (visual analogue scale) showed a score of 2/10 per month. DISCUSSION: There is controversy regarding the treatment of these fractures by osteosynthesis with bone graft. We are facing a case without serious clinical criteria, but with multiple foci of osteolysis. It was decided not to intervene prophylactically the contraleteral hip, since it is asymptomatic and there are different patterns of evolution described in the literature and risks in surgery.",0,1539

1855,"OBJECTIVE: To report the management of a severe and recurrent fungal keratitis that required repeated penetrating keratoplasties. Despite multiple topical, intraocular and systemic antifungal treatments, superotemporal hyphal infiltration repeatedly penetrated the corneal transplant causing continuous recurrences. Cultures collected before and during surgery isolated the same organism, Fusarium spp. CONCLUSION: Corneal infection extending to the sclera and internal angle structures is the main cause of recurrence of fungal keratitis after corneal transplantation. Sectorial full-thickness sclero-keratoplasty combined with a central penetrating keratoplasty should be a surgical technique to be considered in cases where these locations are suspected to be the source of recurrence. It enables a definitive elimination of the infection, with excellent final visual acuities. No postoperative complications were reported in this case.",0,939
1856,"Phosphate enemas are frequently used in the treatment of constipation. Errors in dosage and administration can lead to severe complications. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of severe toxicity of phosphate enemas in a child with no risk factors. CASE: 2 years old female, with functional constipation, was brought to emergency department because abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with fecal impaction and received half a bottle of Fleet Adult(R) (Laboratorio Synthon, Chile) two times, with no clinical resolution, deciding to start proctoclisis in pediatric ward. Soon after admission, she presented painful tetany, but alert and oriented. Patient was transferred to PICU where severe hyperphosphatemia and secondary hypocalcemia were confirmed. Her treatment included electrolyte correction; removal of residual phosphate enema and hyperhydration. Tetany resolved over 2 hours after admission and no other complications. Proctoclisis was performed and patient was discharged three days after admission with pharmacological management of constipation. CONCLUSION: Phosphate enemas may cause serious complications in children with no risk factors. Errors in dosage, administration and removal of the enema are causes of toxicity in this group. Pediatricians and health personnel must be aware of risks and signs of toxicity of phosphate enema.",0,1338

1860,"Relapsing Plasmodium vivax malaria is due to activation of dormant intrahepatic parasitic forms known as hypnozoits. Primaquine is the only available drug effective against hypnozoits and, alongside a schizonticidal drug, constitutes the radical treatment of malaria. Failure of radical treatment is frequently attributed to inadequate dosing, poor adherence, or reinfection. However, several cases of radical treatment failure without these factors have been reported, inferring that metabolic properties of the host or tolerance mechanisms of the parasite may be implied. A case of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax acquired in the Amazonic region, treated outside endemic area, with multiple relapses despite adequate radical treatment is described.",0,750
1861,"Abstrac: Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were considered as having an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation (LT). Considering the increased life expectancy in HIV positive patients under HAART and the improvements in the management of graft recipients, these patients are now suitable for carrying out transplants in selected cases. We report a 26 years old HIV positive male who developed acute liver failure possibly caused by drug induced liver injury who underwent a successful liver transplantation.",0,611
1862,"OBJECTIVE: Multicystic nephroma (multilocular cystic nephroma, multilocular cyst) is a relatively rare benign neoplasm of the kidney. Most patients are asymptomatic and tumours are usually discovered incidentally. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2015, 2 patients with cystic nephroma at our institution were diagnosed and treated. Our study includes two new cases of cystic nephroma and a review of the literature about the differential diagnosis of a cystic renal mass. RESULTS: In this report we present two cases of multilocular cystic nephroma in a 75-year-old-female and a 33-year-old female. They were diagnosed clinically as a renal mass and surgery was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the main treatment for cystic nephroma. The combination of clinical, biochemical and radiological features may help in lesion characterization, but only histology can provide the definite diagnosis.

1868,"OBJECTIVE: Hemangiopericytoma is a tumor of vascular origin. It is very rare in the prostate. They are generally aggressive tumors. Currently, the treatment of choice is radical surgery. In the literature, there are less than 50 cases described, and neoadjuvant treatment has not been reported in any article. This treatment presents positive responses in another type of sarcomas. Our goal is to report two cases of malignant hemangiopericytoma. The first case was treated with radical surgery and the second case was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. METHODS: The first case is a 40 year old male. Obstructive urinary symptoms were his first symptoms. A prostate mass with tumor characteristics was seen on ultrasound. After transrectal biopsy, he was diagnosed with hemangiopericitoma. Because the tumor size, neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic prior to radical surgery was decided. The second case is a 77 year old male with an incidental diagnosis of renal mass. After radical nephrectomy, he was diagnosed with hemangiopericitoma. He did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: In the first case, after neoadjuvant therapy, tumor size was reduced significantly. A pelvic exenteration with radical cystoprostatectomy and rectal resection and Bricker type urinary diversion and colostomy were carried out. In the second case controls after radical nephrectomy were correct and he did not need any treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In urinary tumors, the prostate hemangiopericytoma is a rare entity. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not established as treatment for these tumors. For other sarcomas neoadyuvant treatment has good response. In our case, a good result was obtained with neoadjuvant chemotheraphy before surgery. However, a greater number of cases are necessary to establish the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in urinary hemangiopericytomas.",0,1874

It is a rare malformation with a complex pathophysiology. The perioperative anaesthetic management is not well established. We present a 6-month-old infant diagnosed with pial arteriovenous fistula with hypertension and congestive heart failure due to left-right shunt. He required a craniotomy and clipping of vascular malformation. Anaesthetic considerations in patients with this condition are a great challenge. It must be performed by multidisciplinary teams with experience in paediatrics. The maintenance of blood volume during the intraoperative course is very important.

1872,"INTRODUCTION: Pain and cervical muscle spasm are common reasons why parents bring children to the pediatric emergency department. The first steps are the gathering of medical history of the patient and a physical examination. If musculoskeletal damage is suspected, cervical spine x-rays should be obtained. An intervertebral disc calcification finding, in the absence of other radiological lesions should suggest pediatric intervertebral disc calcification. OBJECTIVE: To present a case of intervertebral disc calcification, a rare condition that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of torticollis and neck pain in childhood. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old male patient without morbid history and no history of trauma or rough sport practice. He consulted the emergency room for pain and cervical contracture for the last six days. C reactive protein and red cell sedimentatio rates were slightly elevated. Imaging studies showed calcification of the C5-C6 intrvertebral disc and anterior disc protrusion. The patient was hospitalized for evaluation and pain management, with good clinical response and continue afterwards with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a soft collar. At the 6-month-follow up, the patient had resolved symptoms and calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric intervertebral disc calcification is a rare cause of acquired torticollis, with a benign and self-limited outcome.

It is also very useful in cases with a high risk of fibrosis due to previous interventions.,0,470
1874,"Radionecrosis is a late, and difficult to treat,complication of radiotherapy performed on head and neck tumours, and it is difficult to treat. This process causes significant damage, not only in the skin, but also in muscular, nervous, vascular, and bone structures. This, in turn, leads to airway and digestive tract involvement, as well as a functional loss and a cosmetic defect that usually requires reconstructive surgery. Therefore, this process is associated with a significant loss in the quality of life of patients and involves a long hospital stay for treatment, as well as the necessary support measures. This article describes the local treatment of pharyngocutaneous fistula secondary to radiation therapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the right oropharynx. The lesion appeared two months after completing this treatment and required surgical reconstruction with a myocutaneous flap to repair the tissue defect. In this context, an alginate wound dressing with silver was used, combined with a medium grip polyurethane foam with a silicone border. Within one month, there was autolytic debridement of all the necrotic tissue and the appearance of granulation tissue. At the same time, the infection was controlled, and a better management of the exudate was obtained, which provided a suitable surgical bed for the reconstruction.",0,1344

1876,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is used as an alternative to enteral/nasoenteral feeding in situations where long-term oral feeding is ineffective or not tolerated. It is mostly preferred in patients with neurological conditions and also to support nutrition in patients with congenital heart diseases, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and various oropharyngeal diseases. Although it is easily applicable compared to many invasive procedures, it has complications ranging from wound infection to death. PEG requires experienced medical personnel, appropriate prophylactic antibiotics and exhaustive information to the patients or their families about the procedure and subsequent care. We present a rare but important complication during the replacement of the gastrostomy tube subsequent to the ""cut and push"" method.

Those affected have a high mortality rate, only 4% may survive their first year of life. There are few reported cases exceeding five years of age. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to report a case of trisomy 18 of long survival with oral cavity features not described in the literature, and to provide information to physicians and paediatricians about aetiology, phenotype, survival and genetic counselling. CASE REPORT: A 7 year-old female patient with 2 karyotypes performed by lymphocyte culture showing 47XX+18 in all metaphases. She presented with growth deficiency, dysmorphic facies, severe psychomotor retardation and cognitive disability, inability to feed, lack of verbal language, sensorineural hearing loss, ataxia, cerebellar hypoplasia, and genitals with hypoplastic labia majora and minora. In the oral cavity: dome shaped palate, macroglossia, absence of upper central incisors and first upper and lower molars in mouth. X-ray findings showed formation of missing teeth, with late eruption being concluded. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of trisomy 18 syndrome there is an increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality. The clinical characteristics in utero and in neonates have been well described. Since few cases exceeding five years of age have been reported, the phenotype is yet to be established. In the case being reported we describe oral cavity findings not documented in the literature.",0,1576

Conclusion: Cognitive impairment of the elderly due to a parathyroid adenoma is underdiagnosed, behavioral changes and alterations of motor functions are attributed to age, dementia and frailty, representing a diagnostic challenge.",0,739
1880,"INTRODUCTION: Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. It is particularly prone to affect the skin and the nerve trunks and, in fact, both are compromised in most infected patients. It is transmitted by exposure to those with the disease and sometimes by reactivation. One uncommon possibility is pure neural leprosy, which is characterised by neuropathy, but without skin lesions. We report the case of a patient with pure neural leprosy and review the diagnostic aspects. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old male, an immigrant who was diagnosed and treated for leprosy 20 earlier. The patient visited due to painful paraesthesias and dysesthesias in the hands and legs without the presence of any skin lesions. Acute multiple mononeuritis with mainly ulnar involvement was observed. The disease, typified as paucibacillary/tuberculoid, was treated and in a few weeks there was a clear improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In this case of pure neural leprosy due to reactivation, early diagnosis allowed timely treatment to be established. Evaluation of neuropathy together with clinical, electrophysiological and ultrasound criteria is recommended. By so doing, a high degree of sensitivity is achieved as well as allowing early diagnosis and treatment, and therefore a better functional recovery.",0,1316

It is characterized by the development of benign proliferations in many organs, which result in different clinical manifestations. It is associated with the mutation of two genes: TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), with the change in the functionality of the complex target of rapamycin (mTOR). MTOR activation signal has been recently described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its inhibition could be beneficial in patients with lupus nephritis. We report the case of a patient who began with clinical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 30 years after the onset of SLE with severe renal disease (tipe IV nephritis) who improved after treatment with iv pulses of cyclophosphamide.

DISCUSSION: Intralesional administration of rituximab for treating primary FL of the conjunctiva was an effective and safe therapeutic option; therefore it could be an alternative to other conventional treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy.",0,625
1887,"CLINICAL CASE: A 27-year-old male with sudden visual loss of OD. He had a past history of heavy smoking, as well as a chronic ischaemia of his left lower limb of one-year onset. This led to a diagnosis of Buerger's disease, which is an inflammatory thrombotic disorder that affects small and medium vessels. The visual acuity (VA) of OD was 0.9, and in the funduscopy a very congestive papilla was observed, along with venous tortuosity, scattered retinal haemorrhages, but without macular oedema. He progressed favourably, with a complete recovery of VA. DISCUSSION: Papillophlebitis may be an ocular complication of Buerger's disease.",0,636
1888,"CLINICAL CASE: A 10-year-old girl was seen with a 3-week history of right upper lid swelling and with no other symptoms or fever. There was no recent history of sinusitis, trauma, or previous infection involving the periorbital area, or response to oral antibiotic treatment. Orbital computed tomography showed a lesion involving the upper margin of the orbit, and bone destruction at the orbital roof. Biopsy performed revealed the presence of Langerhans cell Histiocytosis. The lesion was surgically debulked and corticosteroids were used intra-operatively. The lesion responded to treatment. DISCUSSION: The orbital involvement of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, despite its low incidence, should be considered in the examination of acute peri-orbital swelling. It usually presents as an osteolytic lesion, and it is confirmed with a histological examination and immunohistochemical techniques for CD1a and S100. An interdisciplinary approach is recommended to rule out multifocal or multisystemic diseases, as well as to develop an appropriate treatment strategy.",0,1066
1889,"Hereditary forms of multiple exostoses, now called EXT1/EXT2-CDG within Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation, are the most common benign bone tumors in humans and clinical description consists of the formation of several cartilage-capped bone tumors, usually benign and localized in the juxta-epiphyseal region of long bones, although wide body dissemination in severe cases is not uncommon. Onset of the disease is variable ranging from 2-3 years up to 13-15 years with an estimated incidence ranging from 1/18,000 to 1/50,000 cases in European countries. We present a double mutant alleles in the EXT1 gene not previously reported in a teenager and her family with hereditary multiple exostoses.",0,698
1890,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) or myositis ossificans, is a genetic disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 2.000.000. It is caused by pathogenic variants in ACVR1 gene and characterized by soft tissue heterotopic ossification, starting in the second decade of life. It is associated to early mortality caused by respiratory complications. It evolves in flare-ups, triggered by soft tissue injuries; therapy is symptomatic, using analgesia, steroids and diphosphonates. We report a 12-year-old female with left renal agenesis, hallux valgus and intellectual disability, presenting with a six months history of thoracic kyphosis, tender nodules in the thorax, and rigidity of right elbow and left knee. Clinical examination revealed dysmorphic facial features. A magnetic resonance showed heterotopic ossification nodules, which was confirmed with spinal radiography. These findings prompted the diagnosis of FOP. Pain treatment was started, and prednisone was used during flare-ups. The ACVR1 gene was analyzed and a pathogenic variant, p. Arg206His, was found, confirming the diagnosis of FOP.",0,1102
1891,"CLINICAL CASE: A case is presented of a unilateral choroidal osteoma with choroidal excavation and associated neovascular membrane that was studied using OCT-angiography. The OCT and OCT-angiography revealed an area of choroidal excavation and an active neovascular membrane. Three doses of aflibercept were administered to the patient, which stabilised the neovascularisation. DISCUSSION: OCT-angiography was used to analyse the morphology of the superficial vascular network of the osteoma, as well as to monitor the evolution of the neovascular membrane.",0,557
1892,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the presence of bladder foreign body as a rare complication following intraprostatic ethanol injection. CASE REPORTS: A 71-year-old man and a 70-year-old male with bladder catheter probe due to obstructive benign prostatic enlargement underwent ethanol injection via transrectal echography. RESULTS: The first patient presented a urinary infection with acute urinary retention one year after the procedure. Ultrasonography revealed a 30 cc intravesical foreign body confirmed by urethrocystoscopy. Endoscopic treatment was unsuccessful, and the patient underwent cystotomy with retrieval of a soft, oval, brownish mass. Histological examination of the mass showed benign gland-stromal prostatic hyperplasia with extensive coagulative necrosis. The second patient had an acute urinary retention episode 3 months after surgery. The ultrasonography revealed an abnormal vesicoprostatic mass. Endoscopic treatment was successful, but required 2 sessions. Histological examination of the mass showed acute suppurative inflammation with marked autolysis of prostatic tissue. These foreign bodies in the bladder acted as a nest to promote infection, and generated a valve effect in the bladder neck, resembling a giant vesical lithiasis clinic, which was a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge since few centers worldwide manage this technique for prostatic hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the second report of a ""calculus"" or ""foreign body"" formed by prostatic tissue in the urinary tract after the injection of ethanol.",0,1573
1893,"OBJECTIVE: Testicular epidermoid cyst is a rare clinical entity that accounts for 1% of testicular neoplasias. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report two cases of testicular epidermoid cysts in a 18 and 19 year old males with a painless testicular lesion. Testicular US was carried out showing a hypoechoic nodule in both cases. With the suspicion of testicular neoplasm inguinal orchiectomy was carried out with placement of testicular prostheses in the same act. The pathology report was testicular epidermoid cyst in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular epidermoid cysts are an uncommon benign entity. When there is a suspicion of this diagnosis, based on tumor markers and ultrasound or MRI images, testicular parenchyma-sparing surgery must be attempted.",0,750
1894,"A foreign body penetrating into the intraconal orbital compartment poses a surgical challenge because of its deep location behind the globe and near the optic nerve. We present a case of an air gun pellet lodged into the orbital apex, which was removed via superolateral orbitotomy through coronal incision. This additional craniofacial technique is a safe procedure to access the lateral aspect of the intraconal compartment in the unusual event of having to remove an orbital foreign body.",0,491
1895,"Schwannomas consist of benign tumors that arise from the nerves, however, they are not frequent in the breast. Our search criteria only found 28 cases described in Literature. We show the case about a 63 years old woman who underwent a breast magnetic resonance (MR) because of high risk for breast cancer, in which a lession on her left breast was found. Not only MR features seemed to be benign, but ultrasound and mamography features, too. The diagnosis of schwannoma was confirmed by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Findings in conventional radiology were correlated with those described in the reviewed literature. In our opinion, this case results valuable due to the inicial diagnosis by MR, which is not an imaging proof for bening tumors, innitially. According to the revised bibliography these features are pretty funny, as mamography and ultrasound, with histological findings, are the clues for the usual diagnosis.",0,921
1896,"We report a case of a 37 year-old man with a long history of hypertension under treatment, who was admitted at our institution with intense fatigue and weakness of lower limbs. The laboratory results at Emergency Department showed severe hypokalemia. A study of secondary hypertension was carried out. With the initial suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism, complete blood test was done including plasma renine activity, which was completely suppressed, and plasma aldosterone concentration, which resulted normal. Likewise, an abdomen CT was performed and revealed a left adrenal mass consistent of suprarrenal adenoma. Therefore, a salt loading suppression test was done with subsequent measure of plasmatic renine activity, which was still suppressed, plasma aldosterone concentration, that persisted normal, and a 24-h urinary aldosterone excretion rate, which was clearly high, supporting the suspected diagnosis. After the adrenalectomy, the patient remained asymptomatic with normal blood pressure without treatment and with normal serum potassium levels.",0,1064
1897,"Intestinal cystic duplications are rare congenital anomalies, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1:4500 autopsies. The etiopathogenesis is uncertain. These duplications are cystic, tubular or diverticular structures lined with gastrointestinal mucosa. They share a common smooth muscle wall with the gastrointestinal tract but usually their lumens do not communicate with each other. Gastric duplication cysts represent 7-9% of the gastrointestinal tract duplication. They can be diagnosed prenatally by fetal ultrasound; magnetic resonance imaging characterizes the cyst and excludes other malformations. Postnatal ultrasound shows a characteristic double walled cyst. Newborns are usually asymptomatic, although nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, intestinal obstruction due to mass effect, volvulus or infection are described. In asymptomatic patients, clinical follow-up and periodic image controls are recommended. Elective surgical resection is the treatment of choice, using minimally invasive technique whenever possible. A case of prenatally suspected intestinal cystic duplication is presented.",0,1117
1898,"Infections in humans by Raoultella spp. are rare and the effect that Raoultella spp. might have as a human pathogen is currently unknown. A clinical case is presented of catheter-related bacteraemia caused by Raoultella ornithinolytica, treated successfully with applied antibiotic therapy (intravenous cefepime and sealed the catheter with amikacin).",0,351
1899,"INTRODUCTION: The suspected diagnosis of a Toddler's fracture can often be complicated by an unclear history, the lack of specific clinical findings and the absence of obvious changes in the initial radiographs. We present the case of an infant of 3 years and 7 months old with a history of falling from her own height with a rotation mechanism of the left pelvic limb. The purpose of this paper is to describe the etiopathology, diagnosis and therapeutic management of these fractures. DISCUSSION: The clinical history, physical examination and the use of imaging studies help identify Toddler's fractures, pathology that must be known to medical specialists for an ideal treatment.",0,683
1900,"Multiple Myeloma is a myeloproliferative disorder of plasma cells, which may be complicated with secondary amyloidosis. We report a 48 year old woman consulting to primary care for weight loss and malaise. An initial laboratory study revealed a hypogammaglobulinemia with a monoclonal component and lambda light chains. These results motivated her derivation to hematology: her serum calcium was 11.8 mg/dl, immunofluorescence showed a monoclonal component of lambda chains and urine Bence-Jones protein was positive. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed plasma cell infiltration. A Congo-red stain of a rectal biopsy was positive. The patient was treated with thalidomide, bortezomid and dexamethasone.",0,697
1901,Swelling of the salivary glands after administration of iodinated contrast is a very rare adverse reaction. Its etiology is not clear and although it has a benign course associated complications have been reported. We report two cases of acute bilateral sialadenitis after intravenous iodinated contrast in 60 and 63 year-old men who underwent a computed tomography scan in the previous days.,0,392
1902,"Chronic diarrhea caused by infection in immunocompetent patients is an infrequent condition in developed countries, although certain pathogens,generally parasites (Giardia lamblia, Isospora belli,Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Strongyloides, Ameba,Trichuris and Schistosoma) and some bacteria (Aeromonas,Plesiomonas, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Salmonella or Mycobacterium tuberculosis)can cause persistent diarrhea.We present the case of a patient who showed Salmonella typhimurium in his stool culture and recovered following treatment with levofloxacin for 7 days.",0,575
1903,"CASE REPORT: The case concerns a 31 year-old woman with no previous history who consulted due to decreased vision in both eyes. She mentioned taking 1 pill of ulipristal acetate (30mg) as an emergency contraceptive four days before the visual symptoms appeared. In the examination, a better corrected visual acuity of 0.6 was found in the right eye and 0.8 in left eye (by Snellen chart), and bilateral macular serous detachment. It was decided to observe, and 15 days later she showed a functional and anatomical improvement. DISCUSSION: Ulipristal acetate could lead to serous central chorioretinopathy due to its activity on the progesterone receptors present in choroidal and retinal pigment epithelium.",0,707
1904,"CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 16 year-old girl with unilateral congenital retinal macrovessel associated with peripheral telangiectasia and retinal ischaemia. DISCUSSION: Congenital retinal macrovessel is a rare finding. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this unusual presentation of congenital retinal macrovessel. After 21 months of follow up, visual acuity remained stable, and no complications developed.",0,443
1905,"We present a case of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Along with the classic findings of APSGN, the patient had a positive direct antiglobulin test and an anticardiolipin antibody without any typical clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This case raises questions of the relationship between Streptococcus and the development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children. Our case highlights the possibility that the streptococcal infections in this patient might be responsible for her anemia, either in setting of underlying antiphospholipid antibodies, or in having triggered the development of pathogenic antibodies, which subsequently leads to the clinical evolution of hemolysis. It is presumed that in our case, the anticardiolipin antibody induced by streptococcal infection may play a direct role in the clinical evolution of AIHA.",0,921
1906,"Amyloidosis due to deposits of transthyretin (ATTR) is currently considered the most frequent form of cardiac amyloidosis and its incidence is increasing thanks to the advances in diagnostic imaging techniques. Some non-invasive diagnostic criteria have recently been published on this entity that due to the development of new drugs for the specific treatment of cardiac ATTR, have prognostic and therapeutic implications. That is why cardiac ATTR could cease to be a rare disease and become a frequent one, and become potentially treatable instead of incurable. We present the case of an 80-year-old male diagnosed with non-hereditary cardiac ATTR by means of gammagraphy with 99mTc diphosfonate scintigraphy (99mTc-DPD) following the new criteria of non-invasive diagnosis.",0,776
1907,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms are all severe hypersensitivity reactions to medications. While each of these reactions is a well-established entity with specific diagnostic criteria, clinicians see cases that fulfill criteria for more than one form, prompting discussion on the possibility of combined forms. Such overlapping clinical pictures meeting the criteria for 2 conditions have thus become a topic of debate in dermatology in recent years. We describe 2 patients with cutaneous drug reactions having the characteristics of both acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome -toxic epidermal necrolysis. We also review previously published cases and current thinking on such overlapping conditions.",0,857
1908,"BACKGROUND: Intramural duodenal haematoma is a rare entity that usually occurs in the context of patients with coagulation disorders. A minimum percentage is related to processes such as pancreatitis and pancreatic tumours. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 45 year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis secondary to alcoholism. He was seen in the emergency room due to abdominal pain, accompanied by toxic syndrome. The abdominal computed tomography reported increased concentric duodenal wall thickness, in the second and third portion. After oesophageal-gastro-duodenoscopy, he presented with haemorrhagic shock. He had emergency surgery, finding a hemoperitoneum, duodenopancreatic tumour with intense inflammatory component, as well a small bowel perforation of third duodenal portion. A cephalic duodenopancreatectomy was performed with pyloric preservation and reconstruction with Roux-Y. DISCUSSION: Treatment of a duodenal haematoma is nasogastric decompression, blood transfusion and correction of coagulation abnormalities. Surgery is indicated in the cases in which there is no improvement after 2 weeks of treatment, or there is suspicion of malignancy or major complications arise. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal intramural haematoma secondary to chronic pancreatitis is rare, although the diagnosis should be made with imaging and, if suspected, start conservative treatment and surgery only in complicated cases.",0,1437
1909,"INTRODUCTION: Hydatid cyst, which is caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is mostly seen in the liver and lungs although it may also rarely be found in any organ or soft tissue. This study presents an interesting case of pancreatic hydatid cyst in which the pancreatic duct opened into this cyst. CASE REPORT: A 10-year-old boy presented to our clinic with significant abdominal distension and pain in the epigastric region which had started 10 days previously. Serum amylase level was 3709 U/L and hemagglutination inhibition for hydatid disease was 1/160. At abdominal computed tomography, two separate lesions and ascites were determined, a CE2 hydatid cyst in the region of the tail of the pancreas and a CE1 hydatid cyst in the left lobe of the liver. Percutaneous drainage was applied to the cyst in the pancreatic tail, and the patient was started on albendazole. The drainage catheter was removed, and the patient has since been followed-up on an outpatient basis with no complications.",0,992
1910,"INTRODUCTION: H Syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disease, with a multisystemic character and which can be identified in early childhood, offering the opportunity of specific treatment and genetic counselling. OBJECTIVE: To present a clinical case with ""typical"" characteristics of H Syndrome. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of an 8-year-old male patient who presented with testicular tumours and skin lesions characterised by hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis, language delay, short stature, and joint deformities. He also presented with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, anaemia, hypergammaglobulinaemia, and bone disorders. Histopathology studies of the skin and testicular masses reported lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. Sequencing analysis of gene SLC29A3 showed the homozygote mutation c.1087 C>T (p.Arg363Trp; rs387907067). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with H syndrome, and this is the first reported case in Latin America. The key to the diagnosis is the finding of hyperpigmentation with hypertrichosis.",0,1044
1911,"Background: Gallstone ileus (GI) represents a rare cause of mechanical intestinal occlusion, which is caused by the impaction of a gallstones at the gastrointestinal tract, being most frequently the terminal ileum; its etiology is due to the passage of a calculum through a biliary-enteric fistula. Due to its low incidence, diagnostic suspicion and adequate initial surgical treatment are essential for an adequate clinical evolution. Objective: A bibliographic review on the current surgical management of GI was carried out and exemplified by the presentation a clinical case. Clinical case: 78-year-old male with bowel obstruction, upon undergoing a CT scan, a gallstone at the level of distal ileum is displayed, therefore, an exploratory laparotomy (ex lap) is performed with enterotomy and extraction of the calculus. The patient bestowed adequate postoperative clinical evolution, and the presence of a cholecystoduodenal fistula is documented by an upper endoscopy. Discussion: GI represents an uncommon pathology, however, there is discrepancy in the literature regarding the initial surgical management, especially in whether or not a biliary procedure should be associated with emergency enterolithotomy. Conclusion: GI is associated with complications secondary to diagnostic delay and its late surgical resolution, although the initial treatment is aimed at resolving the intestinal obstruction through enterotomy and gallstone extraction, there is controversy regarding the preferred time for cholecystectomy and repair of biliary-enteric fistula, being the two-stage surgery the surgical procedure of choice, especially in patients with a high risk of complications.",0,1682
1912,"INTRODUCTION: Hydrocephalus is defined as complex conditions influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Excluding hydrocephalus acquired from infection or brain tumors, congenital hydrocephalus with a genetic cause may occur isolated (hydrocephalus isolated, pure or non-syndromatic) or as a component of a genetic syndrome (syndromic hydrocephalus). OBJECTIVE: To present a syndromic congenital hydrocephalus with a known diagnosis, in order to be considered in the study of this pathology and to perform a review of hydrocephaly with a genetic cause. CLINICAL CASE: Preschool with a prenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus and rhombencephalosynapsis, karyotype and study of TORCH was normal. At the moment of birth, the prenatal diagnoses were confirmed and a malformation of cerebral cortical development was excluded. During the first week of life, perito neal ventricle shunt was performed. A reevaluation at age 4, the absence of corneal reflexes bilate ral parietal and congenital focal alopecia associated with rhombencephalosynapsis, meet definitive criteria for cerebello-trigeminal-dermal displasia or Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome (GLHS). CONCLUSIONS: GLHS is an uncommon neurocutaneous syndrome, possibly a sporadic condition that is underdiagnosed. Due to the new imaging and genetic technologies pre and post-natal, today it is possible to achieve a better and more accurate diagnosis of hydrocephalus with a genetic origin, in which the high suspicion of teams of clinical specialists is essential. Without accurate diagnosis, we can not access to a long-term prognosis, prevention of aggregate morbidity or an adequate genetic counseling, which are required in today's pediatrics.",0,1700

1914,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited neuroectodermal syndrome that predispose to the development of tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system. Additional features include eye and skin abnormalities. CASE REPORT: A 12-year old male with diagnosis of MF2 according to Baser et al and presentation in childhood was included. A comprehensive bibliographic review of evolution of the diagnostic criteria for NF2 in children was performed. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of presentation of NF2 in childhood differs from adulthood in many aspects. Ophthalmologic and skin manifestations, and not an auditory dysfunction, are the most common initial symptoms in prepuberal-onset NF2. The most frequent symptoms and signs at presentation are posterior subcapsular cataract, skin manifestations as NF2 plaques and/or peripheral nerve tumors, and neurological dysfunction related to isolated or multiple cranial nerve deficits (other than nerve VIII), brainstem masses or spinal masses. As sensitivity of diagnostic criteria in children is low, those prepuberal patients with congenital or early-onset cataracts and typical skin manifestations of NF2 should be systematically assessed.",0,1212
1915,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) by serogroup W has become predominant in Chile since 2012, prompting vaccination with conjugate ACWY. We reported two pediatric cases in patients already vaccinated, which evolved with IMD by serogroup B.

1916,"INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a fibroinflammatory immune-mediated disease of the dura mater. Its diagnosis requires the preclusion of infectious, tumoral and other inflammatory diseases. In recent years new entities have been reported that can present with hypertrophic pachymeningitis, such as IgG4-associated disease and MPO-ANCA+ pachymeningitis, as a form of vasculitis limited to the central nervous system. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 64 years-old male with headaches and cervicalgia, predominantly at night, and clinical signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression. Following the diagnosis of craniocervical hypertrophic pachymeningitis provided by the magnetic resonance imaging study, an aetiological study was conducted. Infectious and tumoral diseases were precluded. The clinical features did not show any systemic involvement and high levels of IgG4 and MPO-ANCA+ were found in the results of the analyses. The clinical signs and symptoms quickly improved following treatment with corticoids. CONCLUSIONS: IgG4-related disease and MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis limited to the central nervous system can account for a high percentage of the cases of hypertrophic pachymeningitis that were considered idiopathic, and their diagnosis requires a biopsy and a histological study.",0,1328
1917,"High activity antiretroviral therapy may exacerbate the activity of ergot alkaloids due to an inhibition of cytochrome P450. We report a 57 years old female with AIDS treated with lamivudine, zidovudine, atazanavir, ritonavir and cotrimoxazole presenting with ischemic signs in the four limbs. There was acrocyanosis and weak radial and ulnar pulses. A family member referred that the patient used ergot alkaloids for headaches. An ergotism due to the simultaneous use of ergot alkaloids and antiretroviral therapy was suspected. The latter was discontinued and intravenous nitroglycerin, nifedipine and pentoxifyline were started with good results.",0,649
1918,"Squamous cell carcinoma of thyroid is an uncommon, very aggressive neoplasm, having a poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is the initial treatment of choice, although it often presents as a widespread disease at the time of diagnosis, usually with cervical swelling that causes most of the symptoms due to local infiltration or metastasis. Local infiltration from adjacent tumour and metastatic disease needs to be excluded from other primary epidermoid carcinomas, in order to make a correct diagnosis. This also requires the typical cytokeratin pattern seen in histological studies. The case is presented of a 53 year-old man with a medical history of hepatocarcinoma, with a cervical hypermetabolic lesion detected in an (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed to exclude widespread disease. The follow-up of this lesion with this technique and its usefulness is also described.",0,907
1919,"UNLABELLED: Pneumocephalus is an uncommon but serious complication of spinal surgery and its management and pathophysiology is not widely recognized. The incidence of symptomatic tension pneumocephalus secondary to posterior spinal arthrodesis is unknown. CASE REPORT: The case is reported of a rare case of a 41 year old woman with diagnosis of L3-L4, L4-L5 disc disease and left disc herniation L4-L5. A posterior spinal arthrodesis L3-L5, L3-L4 and L4-L5 discectomies and release of the left L5 root, was performed without apparent complications. Twenty-four hours after surgery the patient developed generalized headache, neck stiffness, and dysarthria. MRI and CT scans revealed a huge pneumocephalus in the subarachnoid space, predominantly in the left frontal lobe without midline shift, which originated in the lumbar spinal canal. The patient was treated conservatively, with progressive neurological improvement after 72 hours, and clinical and radiological normalization after 7 days. DISCUSSION: Pneumocephalus is a rare but potentially serious complication of spine surgery related in most cases with inadvertent dural tear during the operation. Most collections are small, behave benign, and respond to conservative therapy. In the present case, an inadvertent dural tear, produced a pneumocephalus. A high degree of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis, prompt treatment, as well as remedying the source of air to prevent unwanted morbidity and mortality.",0,1475
1920,"UNLABELLED: Nowadays appendicitis is the leading cause of acute surgical abdomen. It occurs mainly between the first and third decade of life and is very rare in the neonatal period. The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations differ from the typical signs and symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose, which is in mostly cases at the time of surgery, and 74% of them appear with perforation and peritonitis. During the first day there were no complications; however, antibiotic therapy was initiated due to the risk of sepsis. On the next day there were changes in vital signs, fresh blood by nasogastric probe, acute abdomen data, cyanosis, and decreased tone. CASE DESCRIPTION: A newborn male of 34.3 weeks gestation using the Capurro method, Apgar score 8/9, obtained by emergency caesarean section, in which the maternal abdominal cavity was with copious purulent material and perforated appendix with generalized peritonitis. Surgery was determinate, where they found necrotic ileum and appendix with five perforations in total, so resection and ileostomy was performed. Intubation and dopamine support were required, but removed within a short time, beginning oral alimentation.",0,1190
1921,"INTRODUCTION: Paroxysmal painful tonic spasms (PPTS) were initially described in multiple sclerosis (MS) but they are more frequent in neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The objective is to report their presence in a series of cases of NMO and NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD), as well as to determine their frequency and clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective assessment of medical histories of NMO/NMOSD patients treated in 2 hospitals in Buenos Aires (Hospital Durand and Hospital Alvarez) between 2009 and 2013. RESULTS: Out of 15 patients with NMOSD (7 with definite NMO and 8 with limited NMO), 4 presented PPTS (26.66%). PPTS frequency in the definite NMO group was 57.14% (4/7). Of the 9 patients with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), 44.44% (9/15) presented PPTS. Mean age was 35 years (range, 22-38 years) and all patients were women. Mean time between NMO diagnosis and PPTS onset was 7 months (range, 1-29 months) and mean time from last relapse of LETM was 30 days (range 23-40 days). LETM (75% cervicothoracic and 25% thoracic) was observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all patients. Control over spasms and pain was achieved in all patients with carbamazepine (associated with gabapentin in one case). No favourable responses to pregabalin, gabapentin, or phenytoin were reported. CONCLUSIONS: PPTS are frequent in NMO. Mean time of PPTS onset is approximately one month after an LETM relapse, with extensive cervicothoracic lesions appearing on the MRI scan. They show an excellent response to carbamazepine but little or no response to pregabalin and gabapentin. Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are necessary in order to confirm these results.",0,1732
1922,"CASE REPORT: Two clinical cases are presented of two family relatives newly diagnosed with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and G11778A mutation analysis by optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA) layer peripapillary fibers retina (RNFL) and ganglion cell and internal plexiform layers (GCL/IPL) using macular segmentation. DISCUSSION: The analysis of the macula by OCT segmentation (version 6.0 Cirrus OCT) allows the GCL/IPL to be evaluated without the interindividual variability of peripapillary RNFL distribution or the presence of edema of the optic disc. When an analysis of the peripapillary RNFL, it does not provide information on this neuronal damage, which itself is evidence in the study of GCL/IPL.",0,770
1923,Tumorlets are pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors smaller than 0.5 cm. They are benign and usually asymptomatic. Their diagnosis is important so as to differentiate them from other neuroendocrine pathologies that require therapeutic intervention. We report a case of such entity and a discussion on the subject that can contribute to highlight the importance of diagnosing this entity.,0,381
1924,"Congenital diarrheas correspond to a severe and low frequency digestive disease, with a high mortality. They start a few days or months after birth, leading to intestinal insufficiency and dependence on parenteral nutrition. It must be highly suspected in newborns or infants with diarrhea and severe electrolyte disorders. The diagnosis is based on clinical, endoscopic, histologic and eventually genetic findings. Treatment is supportive with intensive correction of electrolyte imbalances as well as parenteral nutrition. OBJECTIVE: To present a case report of congenital diarrhea identified as microvillous inclusion disease presenting in the neonatal period. CASE REPORT: Male patient currently 3 years of age, son of consanguineous parents. At 10 days of age presents a severe secretory diarrhea, requiring treatment in a critical care unit and parenteral nutrition. Initially he also presented with Fanconi syndrome, which improved afterwards. The suspicion of congenital microvillous inclusion was confirmed later by optic and electronic microscopy, and inmunohistochemistry. A succesful evolution was later achieved maintaining home parenteral nutrition after discharge. CONCLUSION: We present the first known case in Chile of congenital diarrhea due to microvillous inclusion disease and his evolution.",0,1312

A surgical excision without safety margins was promptly performed, followed by interferon alpha-2b (IFNalpha2b) eye drops. After monitoring the patient for two years and after performing a number of biopsies, he remains free from any signs of disease. DISCUSSION: For cases of giant and invasive squamous cell carcinoma, to reverse the order of treatment, by first performing an early tumour excision, followed by the application of topical IFNalpha2b, may prove useful to achieve total remission of the tumour.",0,621
1927,"OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of emphysematous cystitis, a rare, potentially serious disease. METHODS: Analysis of two different cases treated in our center and review of the existing literature. RESULTS: One patient underwent emergency surgery (radical cystectomy) due to the advanced stage of the disease. The second patient, whose was in an initial stage, benefited from a new treatment, consisting of hyperbaric oxygen and wide spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis is the cornerstone of the conservative management of the disease. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial due to the improvement in oxygenation of the tissues affected by the disease.",0,671
1928,"A human coronavirus, called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first identified in September 2012 in samples obtained from a Saudi Arabian businessman who died from acute respiratory failure. Since then, 49 cases of infections caused by MERS-CoV (previously called a novel coronavirus) with 26 deaths have been reported to date. In this report, we describe a family case cluster of MERS-CoV infection, including the clinical presentation, treatment outcomes, and household relationships of three young men who became ill with MERS-CoV infection after the hospitalization of an elderly male relative, who died of the disease. Twenty-four other family members living in the same household and 124 attending staff members at the hospitals did not become ill. MERS-CoV infection may cause a spectrum of clinical illness. Although an animal reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. Meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illness in close contacts of patients.",1,1028
1929,"CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old male with acceleration/deceleration cranial trauma (ADT), caused by a car accident. After one month, he presented with loss of visual acuity in the right eye. A fluorescein angiography test was performed and it detected centrifugal hyperfluorescent lines from the optic nerve head, a characteristic compatible with the diagnosis of angioid streaks. The loss of visual acuity was demonstrated by the discovery of a juxtafoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV). CONCLUSION: ADT can cause hyper-extension of the eyeball in its equator line, producing the rupture of fragile structures such as the Bruch membrane (MB) in patients with angioid streaks and the subsequent formation of CNV.",0,714
1930,"Neonatal adrenal hemorrhage is uncommon. It is present in 0,2% of newborns. Ten percent of the cases occur bilaterally. It can be associated with birth trauma, large birth weight, or neonatal course complicated by hypoxia and asphyxia, hypotension, or coagulopathy. Scrotal hematoma is an extremely rare manifestation of NAH. Most patients present scrotal swelling with bluish discolouration. Scrotal swelling with/without bluish discoloration in newborns may result from different causes. We report an unusual case of neonatal adrenal hemorrhage secondary to perinatal asphyxia, associated with SH. Neonatal adrenal hemorrhage and scrotal hematoma were diagnosed by ultrasonography and treated by conservative treatment, avoiding unnecessary surgical exploration.",0,764
1931,"INTRODUCTION: The association of gynecomastia and bloody nipple discharge (thelorragia) leads us to the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma. This is a very rare benign tumor in children. CLINICAL CASE: A 2 year old male child was referred due to gynecomastia and bloody nipple discharge of the left breast. A mastectomy was performed. At the age of 4 he returned with identical symptoms but in the right breast. A right mastectomy was also required. An excellent clinical outcome was present in the follow up. The pathology reported intraductal papilloma with no evidence of malignancy or atypia. CONCLUSION: The intraductal papilloma rarely affects children, there are 15 reported cases. Ultrasound is the most useful diagnostic method. In male patients, mastectomy is recommended to ensure definitive diagnosis and treatment.",0,826
1932,"The fracture dislocation of the hip is a rare lesion described up to 4 to 17% of the cases and usually secondary to automobile accidents. Generally of poor prognosis and with already well documented complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head, osteoarthritis and heterotopic ossification. The iatrogenic fracture of the neck or head of the proximal femur is a complication even more rare and is not documented its incidence in the world literature. Having as probable causes the irreducibility of a dislocation of hip, more than one attempt of closed reduction, inadequate technique and some problems with the anesthesia and relaxation of the patient. We present the case of a young patient attended in the first eight hours after his accident with an iatrogenic fracture of the femoral head with follow up to 18 months and emphasizing the importance of making an anatomic open reduction and stable fixation in order to get favorable results.",0,959
1933,"The thyroglossal cyst can exceptionally appear as a primary cyst carcinoma. We discuss a series of 6 adult patients, assessed for long-lasting asymptomatic suprahyoid or lateral-to-larynx mass. The images showed a heterogeneous mass invading adjacent soft tissues. Fine needle aspiration biopsy did not contribute to diagnosis. We performed a Sistrunk procedure in all cases, 3 combined with total thyroidectomy and 1 with neck dissection. The postoperative course was favourable. No additional treatment was required, without evidence of recurrence in follow-up. The management is controversial due to the limited number of cases reported. Some classifications based on size and extent have been proposed to define the surgical treatment of such cysts.",0,753
1934,"The association of dermatomyositis with myasthenia gravis (MG) is uncommon, having been reported so far in only 26 cases. We report the case of a 69 year-old man diagnosed with MG two years ago and currently treated with piridostigmyne. The patient developed acute proximal weakness, shoulder pain and elevated creatine-kinase (CK). He also developed generalized facial erythema and Gottron's papules. Laboratory tests showed positive antinuclear and anti-Mi2 antibodies. Further analysis confirmed CK levels above 1000 U/l. The clinical management of the patient and the therapeutic implications derived from the coexistence of both entities are discusssed.",0,658
1935,"Elbow dislocation associated with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and a brachial artery injury is an uncommon traumatic entity. The two references of this injury combination appeared in 2015, although both authors did not realise that they were the first two cases published in the medical literature. Although mentioned in the text of the articles, no mention was made of the fracture of the distal radius in the titles. The purpose of this paper is to present three cases with this new traumatic pathological entity, explaining its pathogenetic mechanism, the treatment used, and the results obtained.",0,613
1936,"There is an increased incidence of hematological malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In contrast, the concurrence with Multiple Myeloma (MM) is very rare, and the possible pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. We report two patients who developed MM 15 and four years after being diagnosed as having SLE.",0,391
1937,"Previous reports have indicated that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus infection could develop atypical pneumonia with fulminant pulmonary edema. However, the target cells of SARS viral infection have not been characterized in detail. We report the pathologic findings of the lung in 3 cases of SARS. Chest radiographs at 2 to 3 weeks of infection revealed an atypical pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation, a clinical characteristic of SARS infection. The presence of the SARS virus was determined by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the infected cells were identified by in situ hybridization in open-lung biopsy and postmortem necropsy specimens. Expression of SARS virus-encoded RNA was detected in all 3 cases by RT-PCR, and the SARS viral signal was localized in pneumocytes by using in situ hybridization.",1,893
1938,"BACKGROUND: Retained surgical items after a surgical procedure is a real, existing, and preventable problem that affects the safety of the surgical patient. Its incidence is not exactly known due to under-reporting of occurrence, due to the potential risk of lawsuits. CLINICAL CASE: A 31 year-old women that had an elective caesarean, apparently without complications. In the immediate post-operative period, clinical features appeared that were compatible with intestinal obstruction, such as inability to channel gas, bloating, abdominal pain and vigorous peristalsis. The diagnosis is made by the recent history of abdominal-pelvic surgery and the finding of a foreign body on a simple x-ray of the abdomen. The patient was operated upon, with a satisfactory outcome, and was discharged 5 days later. CONCLUSION: A retained surgical instrument is an under-reported event that represents a medical-legal problem, leading to various complications, including death if it is not diagnosed and treated early. It is important to know the risk factors and adopt a culture of prevention through perioperative monitoring of equipment and instruments used during the surgical act.",0,1174
1939,"Renal abscess is a rare disease in newborn, but severe consequences can occur: sepsis with high mortality, renal scar formation and risk of chronic renal failure. A neonate with unilateral renal abscess due to Staphylococcus aureus is reported, with septicemia, with no other suppurative focus, nor with urinary malformation, with good clinical evolution with intravenous antibiotics and without surgical treatment, but with renal scars sequel. From this case, the strategies of diagnosis, treatment and followup of the renal abscess in a neonate are analyzed, emphasizing the early diagnosis to avoid renal scars.",0,614
1940,"A 35-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of arthralgia and purple coloration of the skin of his fingers and feet. Hand and foot radiography showed cystic bone lesions on phalanges suggestive of sarcoidosis. Lab tests revealed increased liver enzymes. Liver MRI evidenced an enlarged liver and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Histological analysis of the finger skin, lymph nodes and liver demonstrated the presence of granulomas, confirming the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient started prednisolone with rapid improvement of the symptoms. Skin lesions are divided into two groups: specific for sarcoidosis (with granulomas, lupus pernio-like) and nonspecific (without granulomas, erythema nodosum-like). Specific cutaneous lesions usually cause no other symptoms beyond cosmetic changes. Lupus pernio stands out for having distinctive features but, to the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous involvement of both hands and feet has never been reported.",0,970
1941,"Surgical wound infection is one of the main sources of postoperative morbidity/mortality. Skin preparation with an antiseptic agent such as chlorhexidine alcohol solution is an effective method to reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections. Nevertheless, the use of alcohol solutions is associated with some risk as they are inflammable products. We report a case of a 51-year-old male who suffered an extensive burn associated with concurrent use of electrocautery and clorhexidine alcohol solution.",0,507
1942,"The DRESS syndrome (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) is a serious pharmacodermia which must be taken into account when establishing an optimal early treatment to prevent a systemic and potentially lethal evolution. Pharmacodermias are the third most frequent cause of adverse effects during surgical hospitalization, after nosocomial infections and intraoperative complications. In most cases, they pose a challenge to the surgeon, since their onset is nonspecific and, therefore, can be easily mistaken for a surgery complication. We present the case of a 54-year-old man, healthy and without relevant background, who was operated on two times due to spontaneous abdominal bleeding. Three weeks after the last surgery, and coinciding with the administration of oral metamizole, the patient developed a DRESS syndrome. The initial unspecific deterioration, characteristic of this syndrome, is the main cause of the delay in diagnosis and correct treatment, causing the resulting evolution to systemic affectation.",0,1031
1943,"Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring during spine surgery is usually acomplished avoiding muscle relaxants. A case of intraoperative sugammadex partial reversal of the neuromuscular blockade allowing adequate monitoring during spine surgery is presented. A 38 year-old man was scheduled for discectomy and vertebral arthrodesis throughout anterior and posterior approaches. Anesthesia consisted of total intravenous anesthesia plus rocuronium. Intraoperatively monitoring was needed, and the muscle relaxant reverted twice with low dose sugammadex in order to obtain adequate responses. The doses of sugammadex used were conservatively selected (0.1mg/kg boluses increases, total dose needed 0.4mg/kg). Both motor evoqued potentials, and electromyographic responses were deemed adequate by the neurophysiologist. If muscle relaxation was needed in the context described, this approach could be useful to prevent neurological sequelae. This is the first study using very low dose sugammadex to reverse rocuronium intraoperatively and to re-establish the neuromuscular blockade.",0,1084
1944,"BACKGROUND: The Bruns Garland syndrome (diabetic amyotrophy) it is a very rare condition, with few cases reported in the literature. Clinical differentiation of diabetic amyotrophy or cauda equine syndrome may be difficult. The issue of misdiagnosis has been discussed as a reason for poor outcome after lumbar spine surgery. We report a case of diabetic amyotrophy that mimics a cauda equina syndrome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59 years old man diabetic patient that suddenly begins with weakness of lower extremities and loss of sphincters control. The patient was seen in the emergency room, the anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the lumbosacral spine evidenced spondylolisthesis L5-S1 level II of Meyerding. However, the MRI show no vertebral canal compression, nerve root compression or disc extrusion. Electrodiagnostic study revealed diabetic amyotrophy (Bruns Garland syndrome). The patient rapidly improves with treatment based in antineuritics, diabetes control, physical therapy and rehabilitation. Four months after the diagnosis he recover his muscle strength, has no alterations in the march, no loss of balance, his sensitive is preserved and has no pain. CONCLUSION: Electrodiagnostic and radiologic studies should be used in every diabetic patient presenting with leg pain and/or weakness to differentiate diabetic neuropathy from cauda equina syndrome. Treatment of both diseases may be needed for relief of the patients pain.",0,1447
1945,"Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by blistering after minimal trauma. These blisters tend to form dystrophic scars, leading to limiting and life-threatening sequelae. The anaesthetic management of patients with DEB is a challenge, even for the most experienced anaesthesiologists, but basic principles can help us prepare the plan of care. The main goals are to prevent trauma/infection of skin/mucous, and to establish a secure airway without causing bullae. Patient positioning and the instruments used to monitor vital signs and administering anaesthetic agents can cause new lesions. It is advisable to lubricate the instruments and to avoid adhesive material and shearing forces on the skin. Besides the implications of the comorbidities, there is a potential difficult intubation and difficult vascular access. Acute airway obstruction can occur due to airway instrumentation. We report the case of a patient diagnosed with EBD difficult airway and undergoing correction of syndactylyl and dental extractions.",0,1063
1946,"Introduccion: Los errores innatos en la sintesis de acidos biliares son un grupo de defectos geneticos que representan del 1 al 2% de las enfermedades colestasicas cronicas en lactantes, ninos y adolescentes. La deficiencia de 3b-Delta5-C27-hidroxiesteroide oxidoreductasa (3b-HSDH) es el defecto mas comunmente reportado. El cuadro clinico caracteristico consiste en hepatitis neonatal, hepatomegalia, esplenomegalia, malabsorcion, desnutricion y enfermedad hepatica de aparicion tardia. Caso clinico: Lactante masculino con antecedente de ictericia en escleras a los 4 meses que se resolvio espontaneamente; posteriormente, a los 18 meses, presento enfermedad colestasica. Durante su abordaje se documento gamma-glutamil transpeptidasa normal, hallazgo que es altamente sugestivo de alteracion en la sintesis de acidos biliares. El diagnostico se realizo con espectrometria de masas en orina. Se inicio tratamiento con acido colico oral, y presento mejoria inmediata. Conclusiones: El resultado en los acidos biliares urinarios es definitivo para el defecto genetico y consistente con mutaciones homocigotas en el gen HSD3B7. Este padecimiento constituye un diagnostico de exclusion en las enfermedades colestasicas de la infancia, particularmente el hallazgo de gamma-glutamil transpeptidasa normal o levemente aumentada, y responde adecuadamente al tratamiento oral, por lo que debe identificarse de forma temprana. Background: Inborn errors in bile acid synthesis are a group of genetic defects accounting for 1 to 2% of chronic cholestatic diseases in infants, children and adolescents. Deficiency of 3b-Delta5-C27-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSDH) is the most common defect in this disease. Clinical features consist of neonatal hepatitis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, malabsorption, malnutrition, and late-onset liver disease. Case report: A male infant who presented jaundice in sclera at 4 months that resolved spontaneously, later presented cholestatic disease at 18 months. During his approach, normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was documented, a finding that is highly suggestive of alteration in the synthesis of bile acids. The diagnosis was made using urine mass spectrometry. Oral colic acid treatment was started, presenting immediate improvement. Conclusions: The result in urinary bile acids is definitive for the genetic defect and consistent with homozygous mutations in the HSD3B7 gene. This condition is a diagnosis of exclusion in childhood cholestatic diseases, particularly in the presence of normal or mildly enlarged gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and responds adequately to oral treatment; it should be identified early.",0,2660
1947,"The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is a rare entity that has an incidence of 0.002 % and can potentially cause sudden death. Unlike to the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), usually presented with myocardial ischemia and heart failure; the diagnosis of ARCAPA is often incidental during evaluation of a heart murmur. We report a case of a 6 months old female patient referred to us with a cardiac murmur and a suspicion of coronary fistula. For a proper diagnostic assessment an echocardiogram, a computed tomography angiography and a cardiac catheterization were requested. A small ostium secundum-type atrial septal defect (ASD) and an ARCAPA were revealed. At 11 months old, the patient was scheduled for corrective cardiovascular surgery. The aim of this report is to describe a low incidence and potentially fatal disease.",0,923
1948,"Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis that affects arteries of medium and large caliber, mainly the aorta artery and its main branches. It is more frequent in women older than 50 years. The most common symptoms are fever, jaw claudication, headache, hyperesthesia of the scalp and loss of vision with anterior ischemic optic nerve disease. But, in a minority of cases, less frequent symptoms are observed that delay and make more difficult the diagnosis. Here, we present the case of a 76-year-old woman who came to our consultation having pain in the oral cavity and presenting tongue and neck edema for 48 hours. She had also suffered from headaches during the previous month. Because the physical examination showed clinical signs of lingual ischemia, a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic involvement due to giant cell arteritis was considered. She started a treatment with systemic corticosteroids and a temporal artery biopsy was performed. We conclude, that giant cell arteritis should be suspected in patients presenting lingual ischemia symptoms in order to start the specific treatment early enough to avoid irreversible complications.",0,1151
1949,"BACKGROUND: Dislocation after total knee arthroplasty is a rare complication and a difficult problem to address. When the flexion gap is larger than the extension gap and the collateral ligaments are injured, instability and knee arthroplasty dislocation can occur. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report the case of a patient presenting with a posterior dislocation of a posterior-stabilized prosthesis without trauma. Frank instability in varus stress test and a positive anterior drawer test with tibial internal rotation dismissed the conservative treatment. RESULTS: A constrained condylar prosthesis was used for the revision. He suffered a similar episode after a month, which demonstrated that the increase in the level of constraint was not enough to correct the severe asymmetric instability in flexion due to the damaged external structures. A rotating-hinge prosthesis was then implanted and the patient reported no additional episodes of instability. CONCLUSIONS: We made an exhaustive review of the literature, analyzed the possible causes that can lead to the tibiofemoral instability after a total knee arthroplasty and described some technical considerations.",0,1169
1950,"Spontaneous extrahepatic bile duct perforation is rare in newborns. It is a surgical cause of jaundice in this period and the acute presentation is unusual. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of spontaneous bile duct perforation in a newborn due to its serious complications if an early and timely diagnosis is not performed. CLINICAL CASE: A 10-day-old newborn who developed food rejection, fever and abdominal distension without jaundice, acolia, or coluria two days prior of admission. The laboratory tests showed leukopenia, thrombocytosis, increased C-reactive protein, and normal hepatic function. The abdominal x-ray showed pneumoperitoneum, and the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis was made. Laparotomy was performed; extrahepatic bile duct perforation and biliary peritonitis were noted. Intraoperative cholangiography demonstrated rescatable proximal bile duct and dilated cystic duct. Hepatic-jejunostomy was performed with Roux-en-Y and cholecystectomy. In the postoperative study portal thrombosis was found, so he received anticoagulant treatment. At 8 months of age, the patient had enteral feeding tolerance and adequate weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Biliary perforation is a rare entity and more in the neonatal period, a condition that makes it a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The prognosis will depend on early intervention and intraoperative findings.",0,1374
1951,"INTRODUCTION: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that usually presents in the neonatal period with vomiting, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia and absent ketonuria. Few cases are reported in the literature, and optimal dietary management and long term outcome are not fully understood. CASE REPORT: We report a 2 year old girl with HMG-CoA-lyase deficiency who had limited fasting tolerance on a low protein diet, with several recurrent hospital admissions with severe hypoketotic hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis. We also review the dietary management and outcome of other reported cases in the literature. DISCUSSION: In order to define optimal dietary treatment, it is important to collect higher numbers of case studies with detailed dietary management, fasting times and outcome.",0,845
1952,"Few cases of bacteremic pneumonia by Neisseria meningitidis (NM) have been described worldwide; mostly in elderly patients or those with comorbidities. They appear clinically indistinguishable from other acute infectious pneumoniae, that do not develope the syndrome of meningococcemia. We report a 17-years-old male, without prior medical history, consulting in the emergency department with a 7-day history of productive cough, right pleural pain, fever and dyspnea. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and respiratory distress. He was managed with vasoactive drugs and prone positioning ventilation for 48 hours. Chest radiography showed a right superior lobe condensation. The electrocardiogram and echocardiogram suggested septic myocarditis. Blood cultures demonstrated the presence of serogroup W135-NM. A lumbar puncture ruled out meningitis, and a 10-day ceftriaxone therapy was completed favorably.",0,919
1953,"Diverticular disease of the small intestine is rare, especially when it is located in the jejunum. It is generally asymptomatic, but in some patients it may have complications such as acute diverticulitis with peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction. In such cases, the recommended treatment is surgery. We report a 77-year-old patient with ileal Crohns disease with a long-standing inflammatory phenotype, who developed acute diverticulitis of the jejunum presenting a severe septic shock and secondary multiple-organ failure. It resolved with medical treatment and prolonged antibiotic therapy.",0,610
1954,"Non-invasive characterization of adrenal lesions is a commonly encountered diagnostic challenge. Characteristic clinical and correlative imaging findings may assist in only arriving at a probable diagnosis. Currently, (18)F-FDG PET/CT is considered to provide the most comprehensive imaging information. We here present a case of bilateral adrenal tuberculosis that highlights the need for caution during the interpretation of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and also the need to suggest histopathological correlation.",0,503
1955,"Sickle cell anemia was a rare disease in Chile, especially in adults, however the recent immigration wave from Haiti is changing this scenario. We report a 29 year old black female from Haiti with a non-disclosed history of sickle cell anemia. She was transfused with two units of red blood cells, found unconscious and with jaundice five days later and admitted to the hospital. On admission she had a hemoglobin of 3.3 g/dL, a total bilirubin of 5.08 mg/dL, a LDH of 1,306 Ui/L. She was transfused again, worsening her condition. An alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic reaction was suspected. A direct Coombs test was positive. She was treated with steroids and her serum hemoglobin rose progressively.",0,707
1956,"Illness presentation in the elderly may be entirely non-specific, with fatigue, loss of function or the presence of geriatric syndromes. We report a 90 years old male consulting in the emergency room for delirium that persisted throughout hospitalization without finding a cause. During the course of hospitalization mild fever appeared and a left knee swelling became apparent. A synovial fluid aspiration showed a leukocyte count of 360 per field with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. The culture was negative. With a presumptive diagnosis of pseudogout, cochicine and celecoxib were started with remission of the confusional state. The patient was discharged 13 days after admission in good conditions.",0,701
1957,"Intramedullary spinal cord metastases are very rare and usually associated with lung or breast cancer, with gastric origin being exceptional. Their clinical onset tends to be faster than that of primary intramedullary tumours. The most common early symptoms of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis are motor deficit in one or more limbs, pain, sensory loss, and sphincter disturbances. The appearance of a rapidly progressive Brown-Sequard syndrome in an oncology patient should orientate the diagnosis of this condition. The prognosis is very poor, with a median survival of 4 months. However, recent research has shown that surgery could offer a slight benefit in survival and functionality. The case is reported of a 61-year-old man with an intramedullary spinal cord metastasis from a gastric carcinoma, as well as a literature review of this topic. It has been found that this case is the fourth one reported in the literature.",0,933
1958,"In 2005, a new human coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was identified in Hong Kong. We screened respiratory specimens collected from December 16, 2001, to December 15, 2002, from children <5 years of age who tested negative for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus, and adenovirus for HCoV-HKU1 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 1,048 respiratory specimens from 851 children were tested, and 9 HCoV-HKU1-positive children (1%) were identified, 2 of whom had 2 positive specimens. Children who had HCoV-HKU1 infection had evidence of either upper or lower respiratory tract infection or both. Two patients had disease beyond the respiratory tract. HCoV-HKU1 was identified from December 2001 to February 2002. Sequence analyses suggest that a single strain was circulating. HCoV-HKU1 is therefore likely circulating in the United States and is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract disease.",1,949
1959,"The first imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in China recently occurred, allowing for the characterization of antibody titers in a series of the patient's sera using the following methods based on recombinant viral structural antigens: inactivated MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recombinant MERS-CoV spike (S, or fragments of S) ELISA, nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA and MERS S pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test (ppNT). A longitudinal profile of the infection showed that seroconversion detected by ELISAs based on the recombinant extracellular domain, S, S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens occurred as early as neutralizing antibodies were detected by the ppNT and earlier than antibodies were detected by the inactivated MERS-CoV and N-terminal domain (NTD) ELISAs. Antibodies detected by the NP ELISA occurred last. Strong correlations were found between the S1, RBD and NP ELISAs and the inactivated MERS-CoV ELISA. The S and RBD ELISAs were highly correlated with the commercial S1 ELISA. The S ELISA strongly correlated with the ppNT, although the MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs were also significantly correlated with the ppNT (P<0.001).",1,1226

Early intervention on the 6th week of gestation with a manual vacuum aspirator reached to remove the cervical pregnancy. Ligation of the descending cervical branches of the uterine arteries and a cervical cerclage, were placed before the aspiration, for prevention of possible hemorrhage. Successful removal of the cervical pregnancy was achieved with only mild bleeding. An intrauterine pregnancy progressed to viability without complications, resulting in a vaginal delivery of a preterm live-birth at 35.4 weeks, of a male that weighted 2740 g.",0,675
1961,"The case is presented of a 57 year-old man with a one-year history of enlargement of the left upper eyelid. An excisional biopsy was performed, and the histological and immunohistochemical study confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours, derived from a Schwann cells proliferation. Eyelid involvement is extremely uncommon. To make the diagnosis, a detailed histopathological and immunohistochemical study is essential. This case suggests that schwannomas should be included within the differential diagnosis of any solid eyelid lesion.",0,588
1962,"INTRODUCTION: Bilateral cerebellopontine arachnoid cysts are very rare, and only three cases have been previously reported. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old previously healthy girl presented to our outpatient clinic with a 6-weeks history of frontal headache. They typically would start in the occipital region and then radiate bifrontally. The neurological examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extra-axial bilateral lesion in bilateral cerebellopontine angle, larger on left side. The lesions were homogeneously hypointenese on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging without evidence of contrast enhancement and without evidence of restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging. No surgical treatment was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral arachnoid cysts of the cerebellopontine angle are very infrequent and the main indication for surgery is the existence of clinical symptoms or neurological deficit coincident with the locations of the cysts.",0,990
1963,"Ewing sarcoma is a malignant tumour of the bone that sometimes presents extraskeletal involvement, with the epidural location being rare. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman with paresthesia, paresis and urinary retention. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an epidural mass from C6 to D3. Laminectomy from C7 to D2 and partial resection of the lesion was performed. Pathological analysis was consistent with Ewing sarcoma. The patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, without evidence of disease at 8 months follow-up. A review of the literature on all published cases of extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma with epidural involvement is presented.",0,652
1964,"Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease in the adult, predominates in the pediatric age and is more common in men than in women. The sites of greater affection are the long bones, followed by the bones of the skull. Patients usually have symptoms related to the site of affection, usually polyostotic lesions, monostotic lesions occur less frequently. The study of choice and treatment depends on the site affected, in the skull the main one is the magnetic resonance and the treatment is the surgical excision of the lesion. Clinical Case: A 29-year-old female patient who entered the hospital due to a non-painful, rapidly growing, progressive tumor on the frontal region of the skull. Physical examination revealed a rounded mass of approximately 5 cm in diameter in the left, non-painful, non-painful, left-frontoparietal region. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull showed a lytic lesion in the frontal bone. It was surgically excised with clean edges; titanium plate was placed. Histopathological diagnosis was histiocytosis of Langerhans cells. Conclusions: It is a rare case, with a patient of an uncommon age of presentation, absence of metastasis by means of study protocol and due to the monostotic presentation improves the prognosis for this patient.",0,1286
1965,"In childhood, pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is an uncommonbut potentially life-threatening disease. The greater numbers of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are complications of underlying risk factors such as malignancies, chemotherapy (L-asparaginase), and central venous catheter.

Reactivation has decreased after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Encephalitis has been reported in the coinfection as one of the most frequent presentations.We present the case of a young adult patient with HIV infection and rapid neurological deterioration due to classic clinical symptoms and signs of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, with no risk factors for thiamine deficiency, with images by nuclear magnetic resonance typical of the syndrome, and identification of cytomegalovirus in cerebrospinal fluid. The specific treatment for CMV managed to control the symptoms with neurological sequelae in progression towards improvement.This is one of the few cases reported in the literature of Wernicke syndrome secondary to cytomegalovirus encephalitis.",0,914
1967,"Cicatrizing conjunctivitis is the final consequence of several diseases. The most severe among them are cicatricial pemphigoid and chronic Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Systemic immunosuppressive drugs and steroids are usually an effective approach to these diseases. However, a few patients follow a recalcitrant course unremitting to usual therapy. We describe the treatment with rituximab of seven patients with cicatricial pemphigoid and two with chronic Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Eight of them also received gammaglobulin and all achieved clinical remission. Three relapsed and required two or three new courses of rituximab with good control of disease activity. Rituximab proved to be an efficacious drug for chronic recalcitrant cicatrizing conjunctivitis.",0,760
1968,"Transversus abdominis plane block has become an important method of postoperative pain management for patients undergoing abdominal surgery but the modest duration is a major limitation. We report the successful use of a novel TAP catheter technique for continuous infusion of levobupivacaine in six gynecologic and obstetric patients. Bilateral TAP catheters were inserted at the end of surgery by ultrasound imaging using a Contiplex(R) C needle (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) in the Triangle of Petit or in a postero-subcostal level based on the location of the surgical incision. Following negative aspiration, 0.25% levobupivacaine 5 mL was injected. After withdrawing the needle, while holding the over-the-needle catheter in place, bilateral continuous infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine at 2 mL/h from elastomeric pumps (INfusor SV2, Baxter, France) was started and continued for up to 50h. Before removal of the catheter, a bolus of 10 mL levobupivacaine 0.25% was administered. Successful analgesia was achieved in all six cases utilizing continuous infusion of levobupivacaine, minimizing the volume required. TAP infusions produce significant opioid sparing and better patient mobility. This technique may be a reliable alternative to neuraxial analgesia in major gynecological and obstetrical surgery.",0,1314
1969,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of legal and voluntary interruption of pregnancy due to a mental health risk in the mother. However, the foetus survived and the mother decided to care for the child. METHODS: Description of the case and a non-systematic review of the relevant literature. RESULTS: A multiparous woman of 38 years with unknown gestational age who requests legal and voluntary interruption of pregnancy. After abortion a male child born of 1050 grams was born, intubated and admitted to intensive care. Subsequently, the mother, without the mental problems that led to abortion, gradually assumed the care of the child. DISCUSSION: To address this complex case, several aspects are analysed: first, the change of mind of a woman in her desire to be a mother. Second, the disappearance of mental symptoms in the immediate postpartum. Third, the need to review the clinical, ethical and legal foundations of the legal ruling that allows therapeutic abortion in Colombia.",0,980
1970,"Uveitis is a heterogeneous group of clinical entities that have in common ocular inflammation. The wide range of causes of uveitis makes diagnosis and family support difficult; hence the pediatrician occupies a determinant site to provide a coherent and timely diagnostic strategy. The aim of this paper is to present a 16-year-old patient who consulted to the ophthalmologist for red eye associated with lacrimation, photophobia, and pain. Once the diagnosis of acute anterior uveitis was made, the specialist suggested a pediatrician consult to rule out a systemic disease.",0,575
1971,"CASE REPORT: Two cases are presented of patients with chronic diffuse epitheliopathy (CDE) that showed a favourable response when treated with spironolactone. The first patient had regions of neurosensory detachment (DNS) and the second, multiple DNS, secondary intra-retinal cysts and retinal pigment epithelium detachment. DISCUSSION: After treatment with spironolactone, both patients showed a visual acuity improvement and structural changes (reduced neurosensory retinal detachment and cystoid degeneration). Aldosterone receptor agonists (ARA) used for persistent forms of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy show encouraging results and could represent a therapeutic alternative for CDE.",0,699
1972,"Eighty percent of hepatocarcinomas are inoperable at the moment of diagnosis. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in these cases, but local therapies are another alternative. Among these, Image-Guided BrachyAblation is a safe choice. We report a 76-year-old male with a hepatocarcinoma, who was considered inoperable due to the high surgical risk of the patient. A local treatment with Image-Guided BrachyAblation was decided. A brachytherapy needle was placed in the tumor under computed tomography guidance and a 15 Gy single dose was delivered from an Iridium-192 source. The patient had no immediate complications and at one month of follow up he continued without incidents.",0,692
1973,"BACKGROUND: Adamantinoma is a rare lesion of low-grade malignancy, and represents 1% of malignant bone tumours of bones, and is mainly located in two regions of the body, jaw (ameloblastoma), and lower extremities. The treatment of choice is surgery due to it being a radio- and chemotherapy-resistant neoplasia. CLINICAL CASE: A 39 year old male with a history of neonatal hydrocephalus with moderate psychomotor retardation. He began with pain in the posterior region of the left thigh for one year before admission, which was managed as posterior radicular syndrome. He had sudden intense pain on walking, that led him to fall over. In the examination, left pelvic limb with deformity in the distal third with increase in volume in the thigh, with pain to palpation, and presence of crackles in the distal third of the femur. A biopsy of the thigh was performed, with subsequent local wide excision + replacement of bone with cadaver bone and a central medullary nail. The final diagnosis was adamantinoma of femur. CONCLUSION: The adamantinomas are rare tumours. It is important to recognise this type of tumor from the beginning, since its prognosis is excellent in initial stages. It is important to have free margins as survival is very high.",0,1249
1974,Bleeding disorders are commonly associated with hemato-oncologic diseases. We report a 68 years old male with a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia derived from a long lasting mielodysplastic syndrome that did not respond to treatment with Azacitidine. The patient was hospitalized due to tonic clonic seizures. A CAT scan showed a hematoma in the frontal lobe. A new assessment of hemostasis revealed an isolated deficiency of Factor X. We speculate that this deficit could be secondary to consumption due to the chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia.,0,542
1975,"Patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis may experience an unexpected deterioration of their disease; this is known as a paradoxical reaction. We present the case of a 59-year-old man with lupus vulgaris who experienced a paradoxical deterioration of cutaneous lesions after starting antituberculosis therapy. The reaction was self-limiting; the lesions gradually improved, and the final outcome was very good. Paradoxical reactions are well-known in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who start antiretroviral therapy, but they can also occur in non-HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis who start antituberculosis therapy. In the literature reviewed, paradoxical reactions involving skin lesions were described in patients with miliary tuberculosis. The case we report is the first of a paradoxical reaction in lupus vulgaris. The increasing frequency of tuberculosis in Spain could lead to a rise in the number of paradoxical reactions.",0,970
1976,"INTRODUCTION: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, with an incidence of 1/3300 male live births and a prevalence rate in the total population of 3/100000 individuals. It is often hereditary (X-linked recessive) but sporadic cases are also frequent. The average age at diagnosis is 4.83 years but an early diagnosis is possible. CLINICAL CASE: An 18-month male infant in ambulatory study for failure to thrive and malnutrition was admitted in our hospital for respiratory problems. Hypertransaminasemia without other data of hepatic involvement in addition to hypotonia detected in the examination oriented diagnosis towards myopathy, confirmed by elevated creatine kinase and electromyogram. The genetic study for Duchenne muscular dystrophy was negative. Mutations were not detected. Muscle biopsy showed complete absence of dystrophin. A more sensitive genetic study showed a previously undescribed mutation.",0,948
1977,"T cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare and aggressive mature T cell Lymphocyte Leukemia. Twenty five percent of cases present as a small cell variant, and only 5% as a cerebriform variant. We report a 58 year-old man with rapidly progressive severe leukocytosis, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and pleural effusion. The lymphocytes had a cerebriform type. The diagnosis of T-PLL variant was made by morphology and immunophenotype study of peripheral blood. Karyotype was found to be complex. He was refractory to chemotherapy and died two months later.",0,581
1978,"INTRODUCTION: Periprosthetic hip fractures are those that occur at the femoral and acetabular level. These fractures are associated with a wide variety of problems such as comminution, loose of bone stock and loosening of the femoral stem. Treatment of these fractures has historically been associated with high rates of treatment failures, complications and unsatisfactory outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical-radiographic case of the treatment of a periprosthetic hip fracture, with a femoral revision and metaphyseal reconstruction with cortical strut allograft and cerclage cables, in a multioperated patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the case of a patient with a dislocation of a revision total hip prosthesis with a periprosthetic fracture type B3 of the Vancouver classification, who underwent a revision of the femoral component and a proximal metaphyseal reconstruction of the femur with cortical strut allograft and cerclage cables. RESULTS: The patient had an adequate evolution at the postoperative year, walking with a cane, radiographic control with adequate congruence of the prosthetic components and data of consolidation of the fracture. DISCUSSION: In the treatment of periprosthetic fractures, reconstruction can be done with use of cortical strut allograft and cerclage cables, with good functional and radiological results.",0,1361
1979,"Arterial priapism is a rare condition in pediatric patients, caused by a fistula between the cavernous artery and the sinusoids of the corpus cavernosum, usually secondary to perineal trauma. We report the case of a 16 year old child with arterial priapism of 5 days duration following a fall astride, successfully treated by superselective arterial embolization with absorbable material. Six months later the patient had complete detumescence without secondary erectile dysfunction. Arterial embolization in pediatric patients is complex due to the smaller arterial size and the need to control the contralateral internal pudendal artery to prevent the development of complications. The use of absorbable material helps reduce the risk of subsequent erectile dysfunction and, although it has a higher rate of recurrence, is an alternative for the treatment of this pathology.",0,876
1980,"Colorectal adenocarcinoma is exceptional in children, generally diagnosed in advanced stages, with worse prognosis. We report the case of a 5 year old girl with isolated hematochezia lasting two months without other findings, in whom a colorectal adenocarcinoma was confirmed by colonoscopy. Staging revealed localized disease, extending to perisigmoid fat and a few adjacent ganglia. She was treated by laparoscopic resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, being free of disease at 21 moths of follow-up.",0,501
1981,"INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is the most common tropical dermatitis. It is caused by nematodes hosted by cats and dogs. Humans act as an accidental reservoir. Clinically, it manifests as a slow-growing, elevated linear, erythematous and pruritic plaque, on the sole of the foot. Diagnosis is clinical, based on the morphology of the lesion associated with recent travel to endemic areas. OBJECTIVE: To present an autochthonous case of CLM in Chile. CLINICAL CASE: A 3-year-old boy, presented with a linear lesion on his foot, clinically compatible with CLM. He received a single dose of ivermectin and had complete resolution of the lesion. The patient had no history of travel outside of Chile, but had contact with dogs. CONCLUSION: CLM is classically described as travellers dermatitis. We present this case, because there are no previous reports of CLM acquired in Chile by children.",0,902
1982,"Initial experience is presented by using freehand SPECT in the intraoperative radiolocalization of a parathyroid adenoma in 2 patients, one which was mediastinal. There is only one previous publication including 3 patients with parathyroid adenomas in usual parathyroid localizations. We also report for the first time a comparative assessment of results with portable gammacamera during the same surgery. In the operating room, we obtained images with portable gamma-camera and 3 D reconstruction with freehand SPECT from 15 min after iv injection of 5 mCi of (99m)Tc-MIBI. Both devices enabled the 2 adenomas to be detected intraoperatively, as well as checking activity of the excised gland and absence of significant uptake in surgical bed, with confirmation by intraoperative pre-postsurgical PTH levels, pathology and clinical follow-up for 10 months. Both devices accurately located the parathyroid adenomas intraoperatively, as well as confirmation of their extirpation, but freehand SPECT provided additional information of adenoma depth (mm) from the skin border, very useful for minimally invasive radio-guided surgery.",0,1130
1983,"Eczema herpeticum is an acute dermatoses caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 in atopic dermatitis patients, and is considered a dermatology emergency. Eczema herpeticum occurs in less than 3% of atopic patients. We report a patient with a history of atopic dermatitis who presented to an emergency department with eczema herpeticum. He was admitted and treated with antiviral medications with good outcome. We investigated filaggrin null mutations in the patient and his family and correlate them with the severity of the disease. We present the first Mexican patient with eczema herpeticum, atopic dermatitis and the presence of R501 X and 2282del4 filaggrin null mutations.",0,677
1984,"OBJECTIVE: To report the finding of infrared meibography in a Mexican patient with EEC syndrome (Ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft syndrome) confirmed by molecular analysis of the p63 gene. CLINICAL CASE: A 31 year-old male patient was seen due to a history of progressive visual loss in both eyes associated with long-term photophobia. The patient was born with cleft lip and palate, ectrodactyly of right hand, and afterwards, displayed nail dysplasia, anodontia and alopecia, with which ectodermal dysplasia was diagnosed. The ophthalmological findings were limited to the adnexa and the ocular surface. In vivo infrared meibography showed total absence of Meibomian glands in the lower eyelids and severe deficiency in the upper eyelids. In addition, it was shown that the patient was a heterozygous carrier of a missense mutation R304W (C --> T) in exon 8 of the p63 gene. DISCUSSION: The R304W mutation in the p63 gene region is definitely related to characteristics such as the absence of Meibomian glands.",0,1019
1985,"OBJECTIVE: We report two cases of patients diagnosed with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas of the urinary tract. We review the literature of this rare entity. The objective is to clarify the clinical and therapeutic characteristics. METHODS: We present a retrospective review of medical records of two patients diagnosed with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas, one in the renal pelvis and the other in the bladder. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis and therapeutic alternatives. RESULTS: Case 1: A 74-year-old women with past medical history of left radical nephrectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy six years before for renal pelvis carcinoma type pure lymphoepithelioma-like, stage pT4R0pN1cM0. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine. Five years later, she presented tumor recurrence in the left ureteral meatus, this lesion was resected. The pathology reported a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with marked lymphoid component, stage pT1. At follow-up, one year after the last recurrence, the patient was asymptomatic. In tomography control, no local or distant recurrences were objectified. Case 2: A 82-year-old men with diagnosis of muscleinvasive bladder cancer. The tumor caused right obstructive uropathy without extracapsular, regional or remote extension. We performed a radical cystoprostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion type cutaneous transureterostomy. The pathology reported a urothelial bladder carcinoma type mixed lymphoepithelioma-like, stage pT4aR1pN2cM0. At six months follow-up, the patient had liver and spleen lesions and retroperitoneal adenopathic nodes, all suggestive of metastases. He is currently receiving symptomatic treatment of their disease. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the clinical importance involved in the diagnosis of this entity. The diagnosis influence the aggressiveness of treatment and disease-specific survival. Therefore, concomitant transitional cell carcinoma defines the prognosis. The role of immunohistochemical staining is fundamental, allowing us to confirm the presence of the epithelial component.",0,2124
1986,"Gynecomastia consists of breast enlargement due to a hormonal imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Unilateral and important breast growth requires ruling underlying pathologic disorders out. Mechanical cause is uncommon, causing enlargement by repeated stimulation. We report a 6-year-old boy with unilateral gynecomastia. Hyperprolactinemia is the only abnormal finding at laboratory tests. After repeated inquiries, a continuous breast selfstimulation is detected. Its relation with gynecomastia is verified because prolactin normalizes and breast regressed in further revisions, after stopping stimulus.",0,612
1987,Central venous catheterization is a common procedure in the emergency and intensive-care units. Rupture of the central catheter has been described as a rare complication in patients with permanent subclavian catheters. We report the case of a patient with rupture and central catheter and embolization secondary to intermittent mechanical compression by the subclavian and the first rib (pinch-off syndrome) and its resolution through a percutaneous device.,0,457
1988,"Non-tuberculous mycobacterial adenitis is getting more common in our environment. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials published nowadays are limited. We present a 2-years-old boy diagnosed of Mycobacterium intracellulare adenitis and severe neutropenia as side effect of combined treatment with oral azythromycin and rifabutin, which recovers after suspending the second one. Liver metabolism of macrolide seems to increase other drugs toxicity, in this case, rifabutin. The patient eventually needed surgery due to persistence of the adenitis despite treatment with antibiotics.",0,585
1989,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare entity. It is characterized by a thrombotic microangiopathy (nonimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure), with a typical histopathology of thickening of capillary and arteriolar walls and an obstructive thrombosis of the vascular lumen. The syndrome is produced by a genetic or acquired deregulation of the alternative pathway of the complement system, with high rates of end stage renal disease, post-transplant recurrence, and high mortality. Mutations associated with factor H, factor B and complement C3 show the worst prognosis. Even though plasma therapy is occasionally useful, eculizumab is effective both for treatment and prevention of post-transplant recurrence. We describe here an adult case of congenital aHUS (C3 mutation) under preventive treatment with eculizumab after renal transplantation, with neither disease recurrence nor drug-related adverse events after a 36-months follow-up.",0,981
1990,"Benign intraperitoneal metastatic leiomyomatosis is a rare benign disease that is observed when a leiomyoma is present in the peritoneal surface. Women who have undergone hysterectomy for leiomyomas are most commonly affected. Patients are usually asymptomatic at presentation, being frequently an incidental finding in imaging studies. Ultrasound and CT play an important role in the diagnosis. The lesions are histologically identical to their uterine counterparts. There are different theories about the pathogenesis of the disease, including peritoneal seeding after laparoscopic hysterectomy. Others support the hypothesis of multiple independent foci of smooth muscle proliferation. Treatment, as in uterine leiomyomatosis, is generally conservative. We report a 53-year-old hysterectomized woman with intraperitoneal leiomyomas detected in a routine physical examination as mobile abdominal masses who underwent successful laparoscopic resection.",0,953
1991,"Primary recurrent cutaneous eosinophilic vasculitis is a rare condition characterized by pruritic, erythematous, purpuric plaques associated to edema. We compared and analyze the clinical, dermoscopic and histological features of the disease in 4 patients from our hospital and 13 patients published in the literature. Seventeen patients were included, with a median age of 56yo, a median duration of disease of 6 months. Lesions were most frequently generalized (47%) or localized in lower limbs (41%). The most frequent features were purpuric color (71%), local edema (65%), necrotizing vasculitis (94%) and eosinophil infiltration (100%) in histology. Most of the patients (82.4%) were given oral steroids with a median dose of 30mg. Primary recurrent cutaneous eosinophilic vasculitis might be an infra-diagnosed condition. The analysis of the patients allowed us to propose diagnostic criteria for the definition of this disease. We suggest a therapeutic strategy with high-potency steroids and dapsone, which might be considered as first-line treatment.",0,1059
1992,"A case of a non-traumatic giant aneurysm of the middle meningeal artery is presented in a 59-year-old patient with a history of liver transplantation, liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma, chronic renal disease, hypertension and chronic bronchitis who presented with tonic-clonic seizures. CT and MRI showed a lesion suggestive of metastasis without ruling out a glial type tumor. He was operated through a left FT craniotomy. During the surgery there was an arterial hemorrhage. The histological sample oriented toward an aneurysmal origin that was confirmed with ARM and angiography. A second intervention allowed the removal of a giant middle meningeal aneurysm partially thrombosed. Aneurysms of the middle meningeal artery are rare and generally present a traumatic history. No case of giant aneurysm has been found in the medical literature.",0,846
1993,"INTRODUCTION: Chikungunya virus infection causes arthralgia and arthritis in the acute phase of the disease but, in more than half of the cases, musculoskeletal manifestations can be prolonged over time and, in some cases, become chronic. Although polyarthralgia is the most frequent chronic manifestation, forms with polyarthritis, tenosynovitis and enthesopathy are also common. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with persistent articular manifestations after infection with the Chikungunya virus. PATIENTS: Report of 3 cases of chronic arthritis after infection with chikungunya virus diagnosed at outpatient care in a university hospital of Catalonia, all of them imported after exposure in areas of epidemic infection between 2013-2015. RESULTS: All three patients had inflammatory joint pain for more than one year after acute disease (3, 2 and 1 years, respectively). In all cases, it appeared as polyarthritis with involvement of small joints of hands and feet (pseudorheumatoid arthritis-like). Laboratory tests showed a slight elevation of acute phase reactants, and analyses for immune markers were negative. Two of the patients required treatment with glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine. The course led to slow clinical improvement, but only one of them came to be completely asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: In the differential diagnosis of chronic polyarthritis, Chikungunya virus disease should also be considered in areas in which it is not endemic.",0,1491
1994,"The most common clinical presentation of Toxoplasma gondii in HIV patients is encephalitis; however, the intramedullary involvement has been reported in a few cases. We report a case of intramedullary toxoplasmosis in a female patient diagnosed with HIV/tuberculosis co-infection, and history of poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The patient developed subacute paraparesis with compromise of sensory function and urinary sphincter. The nuclear magnetic resonance evaluation showed a single intramedullary ring-enhanced lesion at the T-8 level which was solved after an anti-Toxoplasma therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.",0,636
1995,"OBJECTIVE: To expose the features related to the diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of paratesticular sarcomas, through the presentation of three cases with different histologies. METHODS: Description of the clinical cases, surgical management, and pathological results of the surgical specimens. RESULTS: We present three cases of paratesticular sarcomas, one case being a rhabdomyosarcoma and two liposarcomas. Two patients underwent a single successful surgery, while the third one required a second intervention after recurrence. Today all three patients are free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant paratesticular sarcomas are infrequent neoplasias in urology. It is essential that the urologist is aware of this possibility when faced with a paratesticular tumor, since radicalness of surgery will be the most decisive factor in the success of the treatment. Adjuvant therapies must be individualized in each case, and the follow-up after surgery should be close, given the poor evolution of these tumors in many cases.",0,1022
1996,"Stereotactic radiosurgery undoubtedly represents an important therapeutic procedure for various intracranial pathologies, especially tumours, although they are not entirely complication-free. Radiosurgery have been considered a good management strategy for the majority of small-to-medium size vestibular schwannomas. The authors describe a case of high-grade glioma associated with a previous radiosurgery treatment for a vestibular schwannoma in a 69 year-old woman. A detailed description of these cases is provided, as well as a summary of the related literature.",0,567
1997,"Naphazoline is a drug commonly used as a decongestant in adult patients. Its indication in Pediatrics is not frequent, being approved its use from the age of 12 for the toxic effects it possesses. Intoxication in children generates a potentially serious clinical picture. It is characterized by the immediate appearance of hypotonia, deterioration of the sensory, hypothermia and bradycardia of variable degree of clinical compromise. Although it is an infrequent intoxication, the anamnesis and the initial management of the patient are the key in the evolution. We present a 4-year-old boy who, as a therapeutic error, receives this drug, emphasizing the rapid and potentially severe establishment of the clinical picture.",0,724
1998,"There are very few reports of pediatric patients with infections by dematiaceous filamentous fungi. In this publication we report a case of invasive fungal infection of the nasal septum by Curvularia spicifera in a pediatric patient with acute myeloid leukemia. The patient presented with a painful scabby wound in the nasal vestibule. Culture and universal PCR were consistent with Curvularia spicifera. Early management with surgical debridement and bi-associated antifungal therapy achieved complete resolution of the lesions, with no evidence of dissemination and relapses. Clinical management of these fungal infections represents a challenge as the antifungal selection and duration of therapy is not yet well stablished.",0,727
1999,"INTRODUCTION: Surface electromyography has become a widely used technique for measuring the activity of different muscle groups. Although the reliability and validity of the technique are discussed, there is an important body of scientific literature that defends the use of this technique. AIM: To present through a case study, the two basic uses of surface electromyography: the measurement of orofacial muscular activity and use it as biofeedback modulator of the muscular activity itself. CASE REPORT: A 10 years-old girl with a dolichocephalic and prognosis facial profile, anterior open bite and bilateral cross bite, bilateral Angle class II occlusion and atypical swallowing with lingual interposition. The MioTool Face by Miotec Suite 1.0, it could use until 8-channel bipolar surface electromyography. Surface electrodes were placed in the orofacial musculature and the results obtained were measured and visualized through the software Miograph and Biotrainer. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm those obtained through the clinical exploration of the patient and support the use of these measurements for the estimation and validation of mechanical models of the masticatory and swallowing system. Electromyographic biofeedback is shown as an effective technique to self-control the force performed in key muscle groups by performing primary activities such as chewing and swallowing.",0,1393
2000,"INTRODUCTION: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is an inherited recessive X-related disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthin-guanine phosphorribosyl transferase (HPRT). Compul sive self-mutilation and dystonia occurs before the first year of age and is expressed by persistent bites on the oral mucosa, lips, tongue, fingers, and shoulders. The dental intervention performed on most of these patients is multiple tooth extraction to prevent serious secondary lesions. OBJECTIVE: To present a clinical case of LNS and describe pediatric dentistry management in patients with self-mutilating behavior. CLINICAL CASE: Male patient, 7 years old, LNS carrier. He was referred to the Dental Unit from the Department of Pediatric Neurology for evaluation and management of self-inflicted wounds on fingers, lips and cheeks associated with weight loss and decreased food intake. The surgical procedure consisted of multiple extractions, surgical remodeling of the residual alveolar ridges under general anesthesia. In the second postoperative month, the patient was discharged definitively, with an adequate nutritional status and no signs of self-mutilation in hands or oral cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Although LNS is rare, it is essential to know how to proceed in order to provide the best quality of life for patients and their families. Early tooth extractions, as an initial phase in severe cases, seem to be the most useful alternative to minimize damage.",0,1460
2001,"Cutaneous fistula of cerebrospinal fluid is a rare complication of neuroaxial blockade. We report the case of a parturient in whom an epidural catheter was placed for labour analgesia and 12h after the catheter was removed, presented an abundant asymptomatic fluid leak from the puncture site, compatible in the cyto-chemical analysis with cerebrospinal fluid. She was treated with acetazolamide, compression of skin orifice of the fluid leakage, antibiotic prophylaxis, hydration and rest, and progressed satisfactorily without requiring blood patch.",0,551
2002,"Actinomycosis is very rare, as well as the central nervous system (CNS) condition associated with it, presenting a mortality up to 28%. Its manifestations could be similar to infectious conditions from other etiologies, thus, having a better understanding of the entity increases clinical suspicion and also it can provide a timely treatment. The clinical case of an adult with edema in an upper extremity is presented as a manifestation of thrombophlebitis and an abscessed axillary lesion, in which actinomycetes infection was confirmed. He presented a haematogenous spread with CNS involvement, with fatal ending.",0,616
2003,"INTRODUCTION: The dynamic increase in the number of triplet repeats of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) in the FMR1 gene mutation is responsible for three OMIM syndromes with a distinct clinical phenotype: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and two pathologies in adult carriers of the premutation (55-200 CGG repeats): Primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) associated with FXS. CLINICAL OBSERVATION AND METHODS: CGG mutation dynamics of the FMR1 gene were studied in DNA samples from peripheral blood from the index case and other relatives of first, second and third degree by TP-PCR, and the percentage methylation. RESULTS: Diagnosis of FXS was confirmed in three patients (21.4%), eight patients (57.1%) were confirmed in the premutation range transmitters, one male patient with full mutation/permutation mosaicism (7.1%) and two patients (14.3%) with normal study. Of the eight permutated patients, three had FXPOI and one male patient had FXTAS. DISCUSSION: Our study suggests the importance of making an early diagnosis of SXF in order to carry out a family study and genetic counselling, which allow the identification of new cases or premutated patients with FMR1 gene- associated syndromes (FXTAS, FXPOI).",0,1240
2004,"Both, generalized eruptive histiocytosis and juvenile xanthogranuloma are dendritic histiocytic disorders (also known as non-Langerhans cells histiocytosis) that share clinicopathological and immunohistiochemical characteristics. We present a 3-year-old female patient with skin lesions that were clinically compatible with generalized eruptive histiocytosis, confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. During her development the disorder compromised the central nervous system, and surgical intervention of one symptomatic lesion was needed. The histopathological exam of the central nervous system lesion showed Touton cells, compatible with a diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma. This case demonstrates the need to consider these diseases as a spectrum of the same entity.",0,798
2005,"Pulmonary ossification is a rare and usually asymptomatic finding reported as incidental in lung biopsies. Similarly, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare cause of pulmonary infiltrates. We report the case of a 64-year old man with chronic respiratory symptoms in whom these two histopathological findings converged.",0,324
2006,"Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of autoimmune origin that primarily affects the upper and lower airways and kidneys. It is very rare in children and adolescents. When started at a young age it is often associated with subglottic stenosis. Subglottic stenosis is a potentially fatal manifestation of Wegener's granulomatosis. Its diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion since it might develop in the absence of other signs of activity. Occasionally, subglottic stenosis may present as the initial manifestation of the disease. Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic visualization of the lesion. The treatment is complex, and it often requires repeated interventions due to restenosis. We present a 13-year-old patient with subglottic stenosis secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis. We describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of this rare cause of respiratory distress in the pediatric population.",0,955
2007,"The non-syndromic anterior cervical hypertrichosis (OMIM N degrees 600457) is a genetic disorder characterized by a patch of hair at the level of the laryngeal prominence. We present a 12-year-old boy with anterior cervical hypertrichosis and mild generalized hypertrichosis. He has no neurological, ophthalmological or skeletal anomalies. The clinical follow up is 10 years.",0,375
2008,"BACKGROUND: Round ligament cysts are rare lesions, often diagnosed as irreducible inguinal hernias. Most patients are in the third to fourth decade of life, but they can occur in younger patients. They are usually clinically asymptomatic or tend to produce subtle symptoms such as pain, discomfort, or a feeling of heaviness, and swelling. Cysts should not be resized with the Valsalva manoeuvre. Ultrasound is the diagnostic method of choice. The definitive diagnosis is made during surgery, and confirmed by pathological examination. OBJECTIVE: To present a case of round ligament cyst, initially diagnosed as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, and a review of the literature. CLINICAL CASE: A 19 year-old female, who was admitted to the emergency department due to her current condition of 5 days of onset. She had an increased volume in right inguinal region that increased with physical exertion, throbbing pain, and nausea without vomiting. A right inguinal mass of approximately of 6cm in diameter was found, which was painful on mid-superficial palpation, reaching a pre-surgical diagnosis of incarcerated right inguinal hernia with an indication of surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Round ligament cysts are a rare pathology, often confused with incarcerated inguinal hernias. Although ultrasound is the study of choice, the final diagnosis is usually made during surgery and confirmed by histopathology.",0,1412
2009,"Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve (ON) palsy is an uncommon clinical presentation of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). There are very few cases in which it has been possible to demonstrate the isolated damage of the ON by avulsion of the roots, accompanied with traumatic axonal injury and intraneural microhemorrhage. We present a 23-year-old female who, after mild TBI, began to experience right ptosis, binocular diplopia, and photophobia. Clinical examination showed a complete ophthalmoparesis of the right ON, without other neurological deficits. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated no structural compressive damage of the right ON. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Gradient-echo and T1 weighted post-gadolinium was made, demonstrating signs of intraneural hemorrhage of the right ON, in addition to traumatic axonal injury extending from the right cerebral peduncle to the orbital fissure. Specific MRI protocols contribute as evidence of an isolated lesion to the ON.",0,981
2010,"The Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) is a rare sporadic or autosomal dominant immune and connective tissue disorder characterized by chronic eczema, cutaneous abscesses, pneumonias, invasive infections, high levels of Immunoglobulin E, primary teeth retention and bone abnormalities. We report a 24-year-old male with a history of cutaneous abscesses and esophageal candidiasis. He was admitted due to a left gluteal cellulitis. During the fifth day of hospitalization he presented a distal necrosis of the fourth finger of the right hand. Laboratory results showed high levels of IgE and positive cryoglobulins. The patient was discharged and was admitted again five days later with a new gluteal abscess. IgE levels were even higher. Applying Grimbacher scale, the diagnosis of Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome was reached.",0,828
2011,"OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical and chest X-ray features of SARS in children to facilitate correct diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical manifestations and chest X-ray findings in five children suffering from SARS admitted for treatment in the hospital between February and May, 2003 in Shenzhen area were analyzed. The diagnosis was confirmed by epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological examinations. Among the 5 cases, 1 was a boy and the others were girls at the age of 4 to 13 years. RESULTS: Of the 5 SARS children, 3 presented a history of close contact with SARS patients. Fever was the initiative symptom, 4 had a body temperature of over 38 degrees C with the highest being 40 degrees C; fever sustained from 4 to 7 days with an average of 5.6 days. All the 5 cases developed nonproductive cough; on auscultation, both moist and dry rales could be heard in 3 out of the 5 cases. Mean total white count of peripheral blood was (2.96 - 6.9) x 10(9)/L, and was < 5.0 x 10(9)/L in 4 cases. SARS associated coronavirus specific RNA fragment was found positive by RT-PCR in 1 case; 1 case was positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies to the virus; 1 case was positive for only IgM antibody and another 2 cases were positive for only IgG antibody. IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae as well as blood culture for bacteria were all negative. Findings on chest X-ray examination: 4 cases showed presence of patchy or macular opacities with cord-like shadows in unilateral lung plates while 1 case each showed ground-glass-like opacity and migratory changes; 1 case showed interstitial changes in the lungs in the form of irregular reticular lattice and cord-like shadows. Two cases received CT scanning and macular-patchy or spotty shadows were seen all over the lung. The shortest time for absorption of foci in the lungs was 7 days while the longest was 33 days with a mean of 15 +/- 6 days. None of the cases had any signs of fibrosis in the lungs. All the 5 cases were completely cured and discharged 7 to 40 days (mean 18 +/- 11 days) after admission. CONCLUSION: Compared with adult cases with SARS, children with SARS had milder symptoms and signs. Presence of unilateral patchy shadow in lungs represented the main chest X-ray findings.",1,2285
2012,Bronchobiliary fistulas are a rare entity of difficult diagnosis. The utility of magnetic resonance image (MRI) with hepatospecific contrast agents to demonstrate such condition is seldom described in the literature. This case reports a patient with pulmonary infection with a past history of hepatic surgery for hydatid disease in whom the presence of bile in the sputum rose the suspicious of a bronchobiliary fistula. MRI with hepatospecific contrast agents showed the communication between the biliary and bronchial tree and provided anatomic data to allow a therapeutic approach.,0,584
2013,"Intracraneal bleeding is a rare complication after raquis surgery. It is believed to occur as a drop in the intracraneal pressure after a loss of CSF secondary to an iatrogenic dural tear. We report a patient who after surgery for lumbar stenosis presented a subarachnoid haemorrhage, an intraparenchymal haematoma, and a subdural haematoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature with such complications after this type of surgery.",0,454
2014,"Therapeutic hypothermia is the current standard treatment in newborns with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, changing the outcome of these children. It is considered a safe technique with almost no side effects. A possible adverse side event is subcutaneous fat necrosis, which is an acute self-limiting panniculitis that develops during the first weeks of life. We report a case of a newborn at term suffering hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with a generalized multiform erythematous rash and firm and indurated plaques over the back, buttocks and extremities on his 12th day of life after being treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Histopathological study after skin punchbiopsy confirmed the suspicion of subcutaneous fat necrosis. The infant developed asymptomatic moderate hypercalcaemia within the first month of life, which was treated with intravenous fluids and diuretics. Serum calcium levels decreased and normalized in 3 months, with progressive disappearance of skin lesions.",0,1007
2015,"CLINICAL CASE: A 51 year-old immunocompetent male was referred due to presenting with a large corneal ulcer with hypopyon in the right eye. Topical amphotericin B, fluconazole and moxifloxacin, as well as oral itraconazole were initially indicated. Following the report of mycotic structures on staining, topical natamycin was started. The result of the culture was reported two weeks later as, Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum), and topical voriconazole was then added. The response to treatment was very slow, and took five weeks after receiving triple therapy (natamycin, voriconazole and fluconazole) and one dose of intrastromal voriconazole, for the hypopyon to disappear. The final outcome was successful, achieving healing of the ulcer. The patient is waiting for a corneal transplant. DISCUSSION: A microbiological study is essential in patients in whom fungal keratitis is suspected. The treatment of choice against S. apiospermum is with voriconazole, but the combination of various antifungal agents may be required.",0,1036
2016,"INTRODUCTION: Rectal prolapse (RP) is related to an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, pelvic floor disease or anal sphincter. The most common causes of RP are constipation, cystic fibrosis, whooping cough and dysenteric diarrhea. However, celiac disease is not considered among the pathologies re lated to RP. OBJECTIVE: To present a scarcely described association between RP and celiac disease. CLINICAL CASES: We presented 2 preschoolers in whom the reason for consultation was RP, whose study was focused on as prolonged diarrhea, due to the antecedent of pasty consistency of stools. The tests showed elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody titers, and duodenal biopsies with villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, consistent with celiac disease. Both had an excellent response to the gluten-free diet, with rapid normalization of depositions, without presenting any episodes of RP after treatment. Both with normal staturo-ponderal development and anti-tTG-negative controls at the annual 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although the association between RP and celiac disease has not been described yet, it should be considered in diagnosis and treatment.",0,1201
2017,"Cerebral tuberculosis TB (tuberculomas) without meningitis is an uncommon disease with a high morbidity and mortality. We report on a case that illustrates the complexity of this clinical presentation. An 11 month old, previously healthy male infant was brought to the clinic due to fever present during the last 1.5 months, associated with loss of neurodevelopmental goals and signs of endocranial hypertension. CT scan of the skull revealed dilatation of the ventricular system with transependimary edema; MRI showed multiple intra- and extra-axial micronodular images and hydrocephalus. Studies of CSF (cyto-chemical analysis, staining, culture for aerobes, fungi, mycobacteria, and molecular tests for TB were negative). Empirical management for subacute meningoencephalitis was prescribed complemented with tetraconjugated treatment for TB and steroids. As there was no microbiological isolation, biopsy of a cerebellar lesion was performed, which revealed chronic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and acid-alcohol resistant bacilli. The diagnosis of cerebral TB without meningeal involvement was confirmed. The objective of the present report is to emphasize the importance of considering this presentation of TB in children, to remark the need of exhaustive search for the etiologic agent by obtaining samples of the different fluids and tissues even if it implies recurring to invasive methods.",0,1408
2018,"Tarsal tunnel syndrome is defined as an extrinsic and/or intrinsic compressive neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve or one of its branches. Its causes include venous insufficiency. Clinical case: 51 year-old female patient from Leon, Guanajuato. Hypertensive, with Guillain-Barre syndrome for eight years, vascular insufficiency and obesity. Her condition started with left ankle and heel pain; she was treated with NSAIDs and rehabilitation and achieved partial improvement. X-rays and MRI of the left ankle showed posterior impingement. She underwent arthroscopy and improved but one month later she presented with severe pain in the left ankle and sole and dysesthesias. Electromyography showed a lesion of the posterior tibial nerve. We had the patient's case history, preoperative tests, and dorsoplantar and lateral X-ray views. The arthroscopic diagnosis was Flexor Hallucis Longus (FHL) tendinitis, synovitis and posterior ankle impingement. Synovectomy, decompression and smoothening of the FHL tendon were performed. The patient did poorly and underwent electromyography with axonotmesis of the medial plantar branch. After the nerve was released, Lazorthes venous plexus was found to be tortuous and compressing the entire nerve tract. The possible causes for this include intrinsic compression secondary to tumors, and anatomical changes of the tarsal tunnel. However, less often varices may confound the diagnosis and cause irreversible damage if not treated timely. The patient is currently pain free and can walk, has mild dysesthesias of the first toe and limited flexion.",0,1592
2019,"Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia is a rare cause of primary hyperaldosteronism (around a 3%) that has surgical treatment. A case of a patient with hypertension resistant to conventional therapy in treatment with 7 drugs who presented with primary hyperaldosteronism due to unilateral adrenal hyperplasia is presented. A left adrenalectomy was performed, and the patient had a good clinical response, with no need of any drug after 2 years of surgery. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia is a different entity and it is not an asymmetric variant of the bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. In the study of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism and imaging tests with absence of adenoma is a diagnosis that must be considered before cataloguing patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and start a medical treatment, because unilateral adrenal hyperplasia would have a surgical resolution.",0,880
2020,"Calciphylaxis has been defined as tissue sensitivity to calcification, described mainly in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, renal transplant, or parathyroid dysfunction. There are few cases described in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that do not suffer from renal failure or hyperparathyroidism. Another case is presented of calciphylaxis in a woman with inactive rheumatoid arthritis.",0,399
2021,"We describe the isolation and sequencing of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) obtained from a dromedary camel and from a patient who died of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection after close contact with camels that had rhinorrhea. Nasal swabs collected from the patient and from one of his nine camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA. In addition, MERS-CoV was isolated from the patient and the camel. The full genome sequences of the two isolates were identical. Serologic data indicated that MERS-CoV was circulating in the camels but not in the patient before the human infection occurred. These data suggest that this fatal case of human MERS-CoV infection was transmitted through close contact with an infected camel.",1,746
2022,"This is a case report of an american woman who consulted in our country for multiple erythema migrans, from which a Lyme disease was diagnosed. This infectious disease is caused by spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bbsl) and is transmitted by the bite of ticks. Traditionally Bbsl had been detected in ticks only in the Northern Hemisphere. However, since 2013 there have been reports in South America. In Chile, Borrelia chilensis was recently described, which does not have an associated disease in humans. Aspects of the infectious agent, its epidemiology, its vectors and new findings in South America are discussed. Likewise, the clinical diagnostic criteria, laboratory and appropriate treatment are proposed, according to the stage in their natural history.",0,792
2023,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a clinical syndrome caused by a loss of cerebrospinal fluid volume, usually secondary to leaking through structural defects of the spinal dura mater. Radioisotope cisternography (RC) can confirm the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, especially in doubtful or atypical case presentations. A retrospective study was conducted on 8 patients who underwent RC because spontaneous intracranial hypotension was suspected, and they presented with atypical clinical manifestations and/or inconclusive findings in other imaging techniques. RC detected paradural extravasation of cerebrospinal fluid in 7 patients. Moreover, there was indirect evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in all 8 patients (early appearance of radioactivity in the bladder, soft tissue uptake of radioisotope and/or reduction in the amount of radiotracer in the brain at 24hours). RC had a significant impact on the diagnosis of 6 patients, and on the therapeutic management of 4 patients.",0,1012
2024,"Pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is rare and belongs to the group of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). These tumours can be found anywhere from the neck to the pelvis associated with sympathetic ganglia. Morphological imaging, for example CT, provides excellent anatomical detail and high sensitivity but lacks specificity as difficulties may occur when distinguishing between tumours derived from the sympathetic nervous system and other tumour entities. In contrast to anatomical imaging, functional imaging ((123)I-MIBG, (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET) provides high sensitivity and specificity in detecting NETs. Early detection of PHEO is crucial and has a major effect on treatment and prognosis. This case report describes the important role of anatomical and functional imaging in a patient with a neuroendocrine tumour of unusual origin.",0,823
2025,"Cranial chondromas are tumours arising from chondrocyte embryonic remnants cells that usually appear in the skull base synchondrosis. In contrast to the rest of the organism, where chondroid tumours are the most common primary bone tumour just behind the haematopoietic lineage ones, they are a rarity at cranial level, with an incidence of less than 1% of intracranial tumours. The case is reported on a 42 year-old male referred to our clinic due to the finding of an extra-axial lesion located close to the Meckel's cave region, with extension to the posterior fossa and brainstem compression after progressive paraparesis of 6 months onset. With the diagnosis of trigeminal schwannoma, a subtotal tumour resection was performed using a combined supra-infratentorial pre-sigmoidal approach. The postoperative histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis of cranial chondroma.",0,879
2026,"Intravesical therapy with live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain have demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of recurrent and high-grade superficial bladder tumors. The use of this therapy is widely extended; however spreading of bacillus from the injection site could be one rare complication that may cause infection in different locations. An appropriate anamnesis is very important to establish an etiological diagnostic of possible infections caused by M. bovis BCG. Laboratory diagnosis at species level is difficult because of the high genetic similarity (99.9%) with the other member of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. We present a case report who developed tuberculous spondylodiscitis by M. bovis BCG, which had a history of intravesical instillation for treatment of bladder cancer.",0,808
2027,"We report an 89-year-old male under oral anticoagulant therapy with a therapeutic international normalized ratio, presenting at the emergency room with right side hemiparesis and aphasia. Neuroimaging was compatible with an acute middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation was reverted with the use of four factor prothrombin complex, followed by thrombolysis with alteplase, with a favorable evolution, returning to his basal functional status.",0,458
2028,"Beta thalassemia intermedia is a quantitative haemoglobinopathy covering a broad clinical spectrum, that results from the presence of one or two HBB gene mutations associated with secondary and/or tertiary genetic modifiers. We analyze the clinical and laboratory features of 29 patients with beta thalassemia intermedia, assessed over a period of 23 years. Median age was 10.8 years (range: 0.34-60.4). Hypochromic microcytic anemia was seen in 100% of the patients, while only 17.2% had splenomegaly and occasional transfusion requirement. The molecular analysis of patients detected: 3 with two HBB affected genes; 2 with one HBB affected gene and alpha quadruplicate/triplicate genes; 23 with one HBB affected gene and alpha triplicate genes and 1 with two HBB affected genes and polymorphisms of gamma genes. The adequate identification of these patients enables us to give appropriate genetic counseling and implementation of regular clinical follow up.",0,959
2029,"BACKGROUND: Clear cell carcinoma originating in the abdominal wall is a rare event. It is generally associated with endometrial tissue implants left behind after a caesarean section or other gynaecological operations. Its pathophysiology is complex and controversial. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented of a 45 year-old female with history of three caesarean sections, who was seen due to having a tumour mass of 6 months onset in the anterior abdominal wall. Imaging studies confirmed its location, and due to measuring 9 by 7 cm it was suspected to be an urachal tumour. A resection with wide margins was performed. The histopathology report was of a clear cell adenocarcinoma originated in ectopic endometrial tissue, with negative margins. CONCLUSION: This is a very rare case, with few cases reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be included in tumours of the abdominal wall.",0,894
2030,"CASE REPORT: The case is presented on a 4- year-old child with congenital esotropia, limitation of abduction, cross-fixation, and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Genetic testing of ROBO3 gene confirmed the diagnosis of horizontal gaze palsy and scoliosis (HGPSS) DISCUSSION: HGPPS is a rare congenital disorder characterised by absence of conjugate horizontal eye movements and progressive scoliosis developed in childhood and adolescence. We highlight this motility disorder as a part of the differential diagnosis of early childhood esotropia with cross- fixation and limitation of abduction.",0,587
2031,"Respiratory tract infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae can provoke cutaneous and mucosal rashes, which have been classified within the spectrum of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This classification is of therapeutic and prognostic importance and has generated intense debate in the literature. A recent systematic review of 202 cases of mucocutaneous rashes associated with M. pneumoniae infection concluded that these rashes might constitute a distinct entity, for which the term Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis was proposed. We describe a patient with acute M pneumoniae respiratory tract infection who presented mucosal and cutaneous lesions that were difficult to classify as erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome; the lesions were compatible with the proposed new disease.",0,813
2032,"CASE REPORT: A 9-year-old boy referred due to visual loss in his right eye after playing with a laser pointer. In the first visit (12hours later) visual acuity (VA) was 0.15. A hypopigmented lesion was present in the fovea, and optic coherence tomography (OCT) showed vertical hyper-reflective bands. In the last visit (6 months later), VA had improved to 0.5, and OCT showed a well-defined area of outer retinal layer disruption. DISCUSSION: An inadequate use of laser pointers can induce severe and permanent visual loss.",0,523
2033,"Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) as postoperative analgesia method has been successfully carried out in several surgical interventions. Postoperative pain treatment for cesarean section is considered one of the important challenges for anesthesiologists due to the risk of chronic pain development and even pospartum depression. Regional anesthesia techniques were effectively used to prevent the pain together with multimodal analgesia regimes in cesarean section. Formerly, successful erector spinae plane block was documented as postoperative analgesia treatment for cesarean section; however, no motor weakness was recorded as a side effect. In this case report, we present an unexpected motor weakness as a side effect of the erector spinae plane block after cesarean delivery operation in a 29 year old patient. To our knowledge, this is the first report of motor weakness related to the ESPB.",0,900
2034,"Large vessel vasculitis and particularly Temporal Arteritis are systemic diseases that may affect the aorta and its major branches, mainly involving extra cranial branches of the carotid artery. We report a 72-year-old man presenting with weight loss, fever and malaise. Positron emission computed tomography (PET CT) showed an extensive inflammation of the aorta and its major branches. Temporal artery biopsy confirmed the presence of vasculitis with granulomas. Treatment with a high dose of steroids had an excellent clinical response. This case underscores the utility of PET CT in the assessment of this disease.",0,618
2035,"Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis is an effective salvage procedure in cases of combined ankle and subtalar osteoarthritis as well as severe multiplanar deformities and severe joint destruction of the hindfoot. Special mention should be made of this procedure in cases of bone loss, especially from the talus, secondary to failed previous surgeries or bone infection, often being the only way to achieve a stable and painless foot and ankle. We present a case of ankle fracture in a patient with associated morbidity and multiple complications following osteosynthesis, in which tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with cemented with antibiotic coated retrograde nail has achieved a satisfactory final result.",0,701
2036,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune encephalitis relationated or not with a neoplasm. Although its incidence is unknown, probably remains underdiagnosed. Epidemiological studies place it as the second cause of immune-mediated encephalitis and the first in patients aged less of 30 years. It shows neuropsychiatric symptoms and autonomic instability. After diagnosis, based on the detection of antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, an occult malignancy must be investigated. While increasing number of cases have been diagnosed and the important role of this receptor in general anesthesia mechanisms, the interaction of the disease with anesthetic agents and perioperative stress is unknown. We describe the case of a patient with encephalitis associated to ovarian teratoma that underwent gynaecological laparoscopy.",0,847
2037,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is responsible for 30% of the respiratory manifestations of the general population. Pneumonia occupies the first place within this group. Among the extra-respiratory forms (40%), the neurological ones are the most frequent. Meningoencephalitis and aseptic meningitis are the most common. The presentation of more than one clinical variant in the same patient associated with primoinfection by Mp is possible. In relation to the serological diagnosis, controversies in interpretation sometimes occur. This is a 7-year-old girl with conjunctival injection, cervical adenopathy, photophobia with bilateral papilla pseudoedema, and scaly rash that develops peripheral facial paralysis and aseptic meningitis. We will discuss diagnostic controversies.",0,773
2038,"OBJECTIVE: To show and report two new cases of urological cutaneous metastasis. METHODS: We describe two skin metastases cases. The first patient corresponds to a renal tumor and the other to a urothelial tumor. RESULTS: 52-year-old female with stage IV renal tumor,which is treated with Sunitinib. 34 months later, she refers ajaw angle skin ulcer, considered metastasis.75-year-old male with stage IV mixed urothelial carcinoma,which is treated with cystoprostatectomy and adjuvantchemotherapy. 9 months later, he showed 5 skin lesionsin his thorax. A core biopsy was diagnostic of urothelialcutaneous metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Genitourinary skin metastasis are rareand have poor prognosis. The largest incidence is in renaltumors, followed by bladder and prostate malignancies.",0,779
2039,"CLINICAL CASES: The cases are presented on 2patients with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis. The first one was caused by Streptococcus bovis, developed after colonoscopy, which had a poor outcome and resulted in evisceration. The second case was caused by a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from an arthrodesis complicated with a para-spinal abscess. It had an excellent visual outcome. DISCUSSION: Bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare, but serious ocular disease that occurs when bacteria reach the eye via the bloodstream. It requires a very early diagnosis based on the clinical symptoms and patient history. A suitable and specific treatment with intravenous and intravitreal antibiotics may prevent a bad visual prognosis in some cases.",0,765
2040,"INTRODUCTION: Theory of mind is defined as the capacity to predict, understand and act when faced with other people's behaviour, their knowledge, their intentions, their emotions and their beliefs. It is proposed as a feasible alternative for establishing a programme adapted to the characteristics of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. CASE REPORTS: The effect of a 'theory of mind' cognitive development pilot programme on the emotional skills of three children with autism spectrum disorder is reported. Case 1: 9-year-old boy, with scarce emotional identification and expression, as well as difficulties to hold fluent and coherent conversations. Case 2: 10-year-old boy, with mechanical, not very fluent language, and difficulties to start and maintain a conversation. Case 3: 8-year-old girl who presents deficits in the non-verbal communicative behaviours used in social interaction and difficulties to adapt to situations other than everyday ones. In the three cases there is an improvement in the emotional capacities following implementation of the programme; moreover, their parents, teachers or therapists perceived positive changes in the children's adaptive skills. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological and structural aspects of the cognitive development programme were well-suited to the children with autism who took part in the research study. Due to the preliminary nature of this study, it is suggested that future research should utilise a larger sample and a double-blind design with randomised case-controls that allow the findings to be generalised.",0,1582
2041,"We report a case of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who developed a disseminated infection by Fusarium verticillioides during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

2042,"Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an infrequent dermatological disorder in pediatrics. Clinically it is characterized by the development of papular and/or nodular lesions of a reddish-violet coloration with local hypersensitivity. We report the case of a 5-year-old female who consulted 1 month after the appearance of the lesion in the nasal arch. A skin biopsy was performed and it reported diffuse dermatitis with a predominance of neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells, epidermal necrosis and absence of vasculitis. No microorganisms were identified. It was considered compatible with Sweet syndrome. It is important to consider this diagnosis in similar clinical cases and other more frequent diagnoses must be ruled out first.",0,767
2043,"Gastric adenomyomas are extremely uncommon benign tumors in children. On histologic examination, these tumors have an epithelial component similar to pancreatic ducts. We present a case of a pyloric adenomyoma that clinically simulated hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a newborn girl. Imaging tests, fundamentally magnetic resonance imaging, were very important in the characterization and diagnosis of this entity.",0,415
2044,"The clinical findings, plasma viral load, cytokines and chemokines of a 4-month-old infant with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were assessed at different phases of the disease. Ribavirin failed to inhibit SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication.

2045,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Embolic and constitutional manifestations of intracavitary cardiac tumors are included within the classic mimickers of systemic vasculitis, especially in those in which there are no cardiac manifestations. We present a case report of atrial myxoma in which the patient only presented systemic symptoms and in whom an initial diagnostic approach of systemic vasculitis was made. We also performed a literature search of the cases described. PATIENT AND METHOD: A case report of atrial myxoma with atypical presentation manifested as a systemic disease with no concomitant cardiac symptoms is described. The case report is discussed and 11 cases of atrial myxoma pseudovasculitis described in the literature are reviewed, emphasizing their similarities and differences. DISCUSSION: Constitutional symptoms and cutaneous manifestations were the most common. Most of the cases showed partial response to glucococorticosteroid treatment, reinforcing the theory of the inflammatory role in its pathogenesis. Mean delayed time to diagnosis was 12.27 months. CONCLUSION: Atrial myxoma is a systemic vasculitis mimicker, this being difficult to diagnose in the absence of cardiac manifestations. This delay in diagnosis entails serious complications.",0,1267
2046,"INTRODUCTION: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a set of neurodegenerative clinical features characterised by a progressive loss of strength in the lower limbs together with spasticity. It is the result of an axonal lesion in the corticospinal tracts. Type 1, known as SPG1, is the most common form of X-linked HSP. This is produced by a mutation in the gene for the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). SPG1 presents with CRASH syndrome (corpus callosum hypoplasia, retardation, adducted thumbs, spasticity and hydrocephalus). CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of three males, two brothers and a cousin (on the mother's side), with clinical features including intellectual disability, spastic paraparesis, long tract signs, facial dysmorphism and adducted thumbs. Neuroimaging revealed agenesis of the corpus callosum and ventriculomegaly in all three of them. Neurophysiological and metabolic studies were normal. The genetic study evidenced a specific mutation of the L1CAM gene (Xq28) in all three cases. CONCLUSION: We describe the clinical-radiological findings in three males with CRASH syndrome due to mutation c.516G>A in exon 5 of the L1CAM gene. These seem to be the first cases reported in Spain, according to the current literature. We recommend suspecting this syndrome when spastic paraparesis, intellectual disability and adducted thumbs are associated.",0,1372
2047,"We describe a case of an epidural catheter entrapment without knotting, kinking, shearing or breakage confirmed by CT scan and how to manage it. A patient was admitted for tibial fracture repair under general anesthesia with an epidural. At discharge day, multiple attempts to retrieve the catheter were made. Contrast CT scan showed the catheter anchored in the left posterior-lateral epidural space. Despite the absence of guidelines regarding epidural catheter entrapment, all the methods described in the literature were used. This is a rare complication and it may be associated with neurological and infectious complications. Radiologic imaging should be obtained to better characterize the catheters' position and plan removal. In this case, tension in the paraspinal muscles or in the supraspinous and intraspinous ligaments could explain the entrapment. General anesthesia with the non-depolarising muscle relaxant allowed muscles and ligaments to relax and we were able to retrieve the catheter intact.",0,1012
2048,"Vancomycin is an antibiotic used for infections by gram-positive bacteria with a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Its monitoring has an established therapeutic range (10-20 mg/L) to prevent nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity due to supratherapeutic levels, and inefficiency and development of resistance by subtherapeutic levels. Nephrotoxicity for vancomycin monotherapy at standard doses according to pathogen and typical regimens (usual dose: 15-20 mg/kg/12 h) is rare and usually reversible. Moreover, monitoring plasma concentrations allows to achieve concentrations within therapeutic range to allow safe and effective drug use. The renal hypoperfusion can cause pre-renal damage, resulting in elevated levels of serum creatinine, resulting in decreased antibiotic elimination and nephrotoxicity. We report a case of unexpected vancomycin nephrotoxicity in a patient with syndrome Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated paraneoplastic.",0,960
2049,"OBJECTIVE: Two cases of metanephric adenoma are presented, a rare benign renal tumor, and a literature review is done under the current WHO classification (2016). METHODS: Standard histopathological study was performed with hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of WT, Vimentin, Racemase, CK7, CD10 and RCC. RESULTS: Neoplasms of 3 and 4.5 cm, histologically, exhibiting tubulopapillary architecture. There was no evidence of significant nuclear atypia and mitotic figures. Immunohistochemical study showed positive immunoreaction for WT1 and Vimentin in tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Two new cases of metanephric adenoma are presented and a review of the literature was performed in order to discuss the prognosis and differential diagnosis of metanephric adenoma. This is a rare tumor and its diagnosis lies on its morphology and its immunohistochemical profile.",0,891
2050,"Obese patients subjected to bariatric surgery have a high probability of presenting complications that worsen with the use of opioids and can be reduced thanks to anaesthetic techniques like opioid-free anaesthetics (OFA). The risk of having to convert the laparoscopic surgical technique into open surgery is one of the criticisms aimed at this anaesthetic modality, facing the possibility of there not being a correct sympathetic or nociceptive control. We present the case of a patient scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery who, while maintaining OFA, was converted to open surgery (exploratory laparoscopy), with correct control achieved of both haemodynamics and perioperative pain.",0,694
2051,Combined glomerulopathy is infrequent in pediatric patients. Its presence should be suspected in those patients with glomerulophaties with atypical course. The influence on the long-term renal impairment remains uncertain. Here we report two children with histological findings of combined glomerulopathy.,0,305
2052,"Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in the world, being the coronary atherosclerotic obstruction the main finding. Although 6% of all the patients had no significant coronary arteries disease on coronary angiography, defined by lumen vascular obstruction greater than 50%. This type of cases was defined by the term MINOCA (myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries). They are usually young women, with cardiovascular risk factors, high cardiac biomarkers with non-ST elevation in the electrocardiogram. The main etiologies are myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome and subendocardial myocardial infarction. We present the case of a 65 years-old woman with history of hypertension and complete left bundle branch block, who was admitted to the emergency department with typical chest pain, complete left bundle branch block in the electrocardiogram, with negative Sgarbossa criteria and positive cardiac biomarkers. The echocardiography evidenced inferolateral regional wall motion abnormalities, and the coronary angiography a single non-significative lesion (40%) in the proximal segment of the circumflex artery. Cardiac magnetic resonance evidenced subendocardial late adolinium enhancement in inferolateral medial with latero-apical extension segments consistent with circumflex artery-related infarction. This case illustrates an example of MINOCA secondary to myocardial infarction with posterior spontaneous thrombolysis, in which the clinical presentation was typical, however the coronary angiography showed non obstructive lesions. Therefore, another complementary imaging methods were needed such as the cardiac magnetic resonance.",0,1672
2053,"A 28 year old woman, ASA I, who, in the final stages of her pregnancy presented with signs of neural deficit that consisted of distortion of the oral commissure, dysphagia, dysarthria, and weakness on the left side of the body. She was diagnosed with thrombosis in a segment of the right middle cerebral artery which led to an ischemic area in the right frontal lobe. Termination of pregnancy and conservative treatment was decided, with good resolution of the symptoms.",0,470
2054,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Methaemoglobinaemia is a typical acute intoxication disorder in children under one year old. It is produced by excess nitrates which induce the haemoglobin's iron oxidation, preventing its adequate binding to oxygen. It is more frequent in infants due to its lower enzymatic activity. PATIENTS: Two cases of 15-month-old infants with methaemoglobinaemia after the intake of vegetables, atypical by the age of the patients and the initial severity in the first case that simulated a septic syndrome. Both cases evolved well with adequate oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the most frequent clinical manifestation is cyanosis associated with respiratory distress, methaemoglobinaemia can present with more severe and confusing symptoms. The main treatment is oxygen therapy at high concentrations and methylene blue as an intravenous antidote only in selected cases. The intake of vegetables is the main cause of this in infants, so it is important to give adequate information to parents about the consumption and preservation of these foods during the first year of life.",0,1102
2055,"Hydatidosis caused by echinococcus granulosus may affect any organ in the body, with the lungs and the liver as the most commonly affected organs. Vertebral compromise resulting from echinococcus granulosus has a low prevalence and accounts for less than 1% of bone compromise. We report the case of a 50 year-old female who presented at the Trauma Service with progressive low back pain with 5 months of duration that irradiated to the right lower limb, and led to neurologic compromise of the limb. Imaging studies showed spondylodiscitis at T12-L1, confirmed by a biopsy. Treatment of this condition is both orthopedic and surgical. The recurrence rate is high, between 30 and 40%. The objective of describing this case is to propose the differential diagnosis of a vertebral mass of unknown origin and provide details as to how to manage this condition.",0,857
2056,"INTRODUCTION: Mastocytosis represents a group of diseases characterised by an excesive accumulation of mastocytes in one or multiple tissues. It can affect only the skin, or have a systemic involvement. It has a low prevalence, and the prognosis is benign in children. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of urticaria pigmentosa as a subtype of cutaneous mastocytosis, and present a literature review focused on clinical findings, diagnosis and initial basic management. CLINICAL CASE: A child of six months of age presenting with multiple blemishes and light brown papules located on the trunk, arms and legs. The symptoms were compatible with urticaria pigmentosa, and was confirmed by biopsy. Tests to rule out systemic involvement were requested. The patient was treated with general measures, education, and antihistamines, with favourable results. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous mastocytosis is a rare disease with a good prognosis. In childhood general measures and education are usually enough to obtain favourable results. Histamine H1 antagonists are the first line drug treatment.",0,1075
2057,"INTRODUCTION: Medullary carcinoma accounts for 1-2% of all thyroid malignancies. 13-20% of patients present with distant metastasis, with 45% of the cases affecting the liver. CLINICAL CASE: A 50-year-old woman, diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma, was treated with total thyroidectomy and a modified neck dissection in 1999. Two lymph node recurrences in the neck were treated with surgical resection; during surveillance, she developed elevated calcitonin levels, the recurrence site was identified with (18)F-DOPA PET/CT in the liver. Metabolic activity was not associated with a visible lesion in CT, MRI nor ultrasound. Radioguided surgery with (18)F-DOPA allowed an anatomic resection of segments IVb and V. DISCUSSION: In patients with medullary carcinoma and elevated calcitonin during surveillance, (18)F-DOPA PET/CT is an option to evaluate the site of recurrence. Radioguided resection was feasible in this patient, whose hepatic recurrence was not visible with any other imaging method. CONCLUSION: Radioguided hepatic resection with (18)F-DOPA in metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma is feasible when the recurrence site is not anatomically identified by any other imaging studies.",0,1203
2058,"INTRODUCTION: Spine involvement in gout is an extremely uncommon complication. Dorsalgia and quadriplegia are some manifestations that may occur, although these symptoms are seen more frequently in other more prevalent pathologies, such as spinal tumors. CASE REPORT: We present an unusual case of thoracic spinal cord compression at T10-T11 level caused by the extradural deposit of tophaceous material in a 52-year-old woman with uncontrolled chronic tophaceous gout. In addition to intensive medical treatment, the patient required surgery (hemilaminectomy and spinal decompression) and subsequent rehabilitation.

2059,"Angiosarcoma of the gallbladder is an infrequent pathology but has a high morbidity and mortality. There are only 10 references in the international literature. We present a case treated in our center and we review the cases published since 1956. An 81 year-old male patient with abdominal pain, asthenia and dyspnea. Analytically anemia and leukocytosis. Exploration found a distended abdomen, right hypochondrium pain, with defense. Abdominal echography and a CT were requested with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and he was admitted for antibiotic treatment. The patient did not evolve favorably and was subjected to emergency surgery, which found a haemoperitoneum and a gallbladder with a tumoral appearance that could not be totally extirpated. He died 20 days after the operation. The report from pathological anatomy was compatible with epithelioid angiosarcoma of the biliary gallbladder. Gallbladder angiosarcoma is a neoplasia with a bad prognosis, whose clinical presentation can be mistaken for acute cholecystitis. Improving the prognosis of this disease involves carrying out early diagnosis and surgical treatment.",0,1134

2064,"We present here the case of a previously healthy 5 year-old boy hospitalized in an intensive care unit due to tonic-clonic seizures focused on the face and right side of the body, and axillary temperature of 37.4 degrees C. Common bacterial and viral etiology was ruled out through studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was suspected by a positive immunofluorescence serum test for IgM class antibodies. Finally, with a brain biopsy, M. pneumoniae was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis by pathological anatomy. The patient was treated with clarithromycin and had an uneventful evolution. At least to our knowledge, this is the first case in which M. pneumoniae DNA was detected by PCR in a brain biopsy.",0,785
2065,"BACKGROUND: The acute scrotum is an emergency. Testicular torsion represents approximately 25% of the causes. The annual incidence of testicular torsion is approximately 1/4,000 persons under 25 years, with highest prevalence between 12 and 18 years old. It usually occurs without apparent cause, but it has been associated with anatomical, traumatic, and environmental factors, among others. CLINICAL CASE: A male 15 year-old male, with no history of importance, was seen in the Emergency Department, presenting with a sudden and continuous pain in the left testicle. It was accompanied by a pain that radiated to the abdomen and left inguinal area, with nausea and vomiting of more than 12h onset. Doppler ultrasound showed changes suggestive of testicular torsion. Surgery was performed that showed findings of a necrotic left testicle with rotation of the spermatic cord of 360 degrees . A left orchiectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular torsion should always be considered one of the leading causes of acute scrotal pain. Delays in diagnosis should be avoided as this is directly related to the percentage of testicular salvage or loss.",0,1149
2066,"INTRODUCTION: Fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI) is a benign, soft tissue tumor that usually oc curs in children and has a characteristic histological morphology. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of congenital FHI with atypical histological and clinical characteristics. CLINICAL CASE: Full-term male newborn, with no perinatal morbid history was referred to dermatology due to a congenital erythe matous plaque in the umbilical region. The histological study showed a fusocelullar proliferation in dermis and hypodermis of biphasic distribution, with an infiltrative, swirling pattern and bundles of spindle fibroblast-like and myofibroblast-like cells, associated in depth with a mature adipose tissue component. The immunohistochemical study revealed diffuse positivity for CD34, and focal posi tivity for FXIIIa, without immunoreactivity for actin, desmin, MyoD1, S100, HMB45, Melan-A, or EMA. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative for platelet-derived growth factor recep tor beta (PDGFR-beta) and for ETV6 gene. PDGFR-beta and ETV6 gene are present in congenital dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and infantile fibrosarcoma, respectively. This history, in addition to previous histological findings, supported the diagnosis of FHI. Surgical resection was performed, without signs of recurrence during clinical follow-up. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider the FHI within the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous tumors in children, especially in those under two years of age. Although its behavior is benign, it is similar to multiple benign and malignant le sions, which makes it imperative to perform a histological study in front of suspicious clinical lesions.",0,1688
2067,"INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.",0,1740
2068,"BACKGROUND: Vanishing white matter disease is one of the most frequent leukodystrophies in childhood with an autosomal recessive inheritance. A mutation in one of the genes encoding the five subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2B5) is present in 90% of the cases. The diagnosis can be accomplished by the clinical and neuroradiological findings and molecular tests. CASE REPORT: We describe a thirteen-month-old male with previous normal neurodevelopment, who was hospitalized for vomiting, hyperthermia and irritability. On examination, cephalic perimeter and cranial pairs were normal. Hypotonia, increased muscle stretching reflexes, generalized white matter hypodensity on cranial tomography were found. Fifteen days after discharge, he suffered minor head trauma presenting drowsiness and focal seizures. Magnetic resonance showed generalized hypointensity of white matter. Vanishing white matter disease was suspected, and confirmed by sequencing of the EIF2B5 gene, revealing a homozygous c.318A> T mutation in exon 2. Subsequently, visual acuity was lost and cognitive and motor deterioration was evident. The patient died at six years of age due to severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This case contributes to the knowledge of the mutational spectrum present in Mexican patients and allows to extend the phenotype associated to this mutation.",0,1361
2069,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe the surgical technique of laparoscopic resection in malignant tumors greater than 10 cm. METHODS: We present two cases, a 63 year old woman with a left adrenal heterogeneous mass of 11 cm in maximum diameter and an 80 year old man with a left adrenal heterogeneous mass 13 cm in maximum diameter. In both cases excision was performed laparoscopically using 4 trocars and the Alexis(R) wound retractor for specimen extraction. RESULTS: For the 63 year old woman, the histological result was malignant epithelioid angiomyolipoma, while in the case of the 80 year old man was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with possible pulmonary origin. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that laparoscopic surgery of large masses of malignant behavior depends on the capsular integrity and their relationship to adjacent structures rather than tumor size or the internal characteristics of tumor on imaging tests.",0,940
2070,"Three cases of patients with decreased visual acuity and papillitis at onset with subsequent macular star development after a few weeks are presented. Complementary tests were unremarkable in all included patients. Based on this clinical context, they were diagnosed with Leber's idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis, were treated with corticosteroids, as well as with antibiotics in 2cases. All patients showed favourable outcomes, although signs of papillary atrophy were observed in the affected eyes. Leber's idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis diagnosis can be challenging due to the wide spectrum of conditions that have to be ruled out. In addition, macular star may appear later on, which should not exclude its diagnosis. Use of antibiotics and/or corticosteroids is controversial considering its benign nature, but should be considered in selected severe cases. Moreover, the routine use of complementary tests should be carefully evaluated, mainly those that can be aggressive and/or expensive, which should be rationally used.",0,1035
2071,"An 11 year-old girl presented with a recent growth pigmented conjuntival lesion in the bulbar conjunctiva of left eye. Due to the the biomicroscopic and ultrasound findings, an excisional biopsy was performed on the lesion using the <<no touch>> technique, as well as cryo-coagulation of surgical margins. Histopathological examination revealed an inflammatory compound nevus. Melanotic conjunctival tumours are mostly benign. However, the recent growth of a lesion, its vascularisation, irregularities of the margins, and colour change must suggest it has turned malignant. In such case, excision of the lesion is mandatory. Despite all the clinical changes, especially in young patients, it can still be an inflammatory compound nevus.",0,737
2072,"Background: Aneurysm of the testicular artery is a rare entity; the term is described as the dilation of any blood vessel in the body. Case report: An 18-year-old patient with a left testicular artery aneurysm, with no family or personal history of medical importance, presented for consultation due to a volume increase of long evolution in the inguinal region, accompanied by sporadic pain with no other symptoms. The testicular artery aneurysm was not detectable preoperatively by ultrasound, which only reported data compatible with left inguinal hernia and varicocele. The diagnosis was made postoperatively by a histopathological study. This case highlights the presentation of a true aneurysm of the testicular artery and the result after definitive surgical treatment. Conclusions: The etiology of the aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm reported in the literature is described after a testicular trauma and, a few cases of congenital origin. The clinical manifestations are pain and an inguinal mass, which can be frequently confused with inguinal hernias or an aggregated pathology. Therefore, the approach of patients with inguinal or testicular pathology should be protocolized and include aneurysm within the differential diagnoses.",0,1237
2073,"OBJECTIVE: Lymphangiomatosis is a rare disease affecting lymphatic vessels that causes a marked increase of them in the affected area. The final objective of treatment of the genital disease is to preserve sexual function and voiding with a satisfactory aesthetic result with the aim to minimize the emotional impact. METHODS: For the first time in children, we report a case of local reconstruction using artificial dermis after the excision of a genital lymphatic malformation in an eight year old patient. RESULTS: We performed surgical excision of the lymphatic malformation genital component and reconstruction of the scrotal and penile area in two steps, using an autologous graft over artificial dermis. No complications were registered. Both aesthetic and functional results were excellent, and spontaneous erections that were not present before, were also evidenced. No local recurrence was seen at two year follow up. CONCLUSION: The use of artificial dermis for genital surface reconstruction enables radical excision of tissues involved by diffuse lymphangiomatosis in this location. Surgical technique is simple, postoperative care is easy, being ambulatory care feasible. Final result is an elastic, fine skin, very satisfactory aesthetically, and functionally normal, which even keeps local sensitivity. In the long term, this will benefit the sexual field, so damaged in this patients.",0,1401
2074,"Paradoxical reaction to antituberculosis treatment is rare in paediatric population. We report a 9-year-old girl with high fever and productive cough for the last three weeks. Tuberculine test and Quantiferon were positive, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 64 mm/h, culture and polymerase chain reaction for M. tuberculosis negative, and chest X ray showed a widened right mediastinum. Tuberculosis was diagnosed, therefore treatment with standard doses of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was started. Twenty-one days later she presented high fever with no other symptoms, worsening of radiological findings and normal blood tests, serologies and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The patient presented a paradoxical reaction and was given prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, fever disappeared in 24 hours. It is important to consider a paradoxical reaction when other causes of clinical and/or radiological worsening have been ruled out, to avoid unnecessary tests and treatment modifications.",0,1003

2077,"The irreducible dislocation of the hallux interphalangeal joint is an infrequent condition and only a few cases have been described. It presents as dorsal dislocation with interposition of the sesamoid bone, which has the possibility of being radiologically undetectable. We present the case of a 29 year-old patient who, after a sports trauma sustained a hallux interphalangeal dislocation that went unnoticed for eight days. Since, closed reduction was not possible, as occurred in several cases reported in the literature, open reduction was performed through a dorsal incision. Based on a bibliographic review, it is possible to state that there are several treatment options and multiple approaches, and that these lesions usually have a good prognosis.",0,758

2080,"CASE REPORT: The case of a patient with previous uncomplicated XEN((R)) drainage glaucoma surgery is described, who presented with hypertrophic bleb and mechanical ectropion. Treatment consisted of the <<Dry Lake>> procedure to drain the hypertrophic bleb following blockage with viscoelastic of the ab-interno stent and bleb sealing with a tissue adhesive. DISCUSSION: Proposals for the management of this type of bleb include therapeutic strategies, sutures or even autologous blood. The use of Tissucol((R)), already described in glaucoma surgery, may be appropriate to treat this complication of XEN((R)) placement.",0,619
2081,"Central venous catheters are widely used in critically ill patients; however, they are also associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The literature may underestimate the incidence of catheter-inducible right atrial thrombi that are asymptomatic but potentially life threatening. The recognized risk factors for its development include infections related to the catheter, endothelial injury secondary to mechanical and chemical damage induced by certain medications and infused fluids. The characteristics of the patient and the catheter, such as size, material, type, location and ease of insertion, as well as the duration of placement play an additional role. We report the case of a 38-year-old man, who developed an asymptomatic catheter-inducible right atrial thrombi requiring open heart surgery, after taking a central venous catheter for thirty-five days. The present case highlights existing limitations in making a correct and fast diagnosis, which should be anticipated in patients with multiple risk factors for thrombosis. Given the limited recommendations available, we consider that the most appropriate strategy should be individualized.",0,1163

2084,"Disorders of urea cycle account for up to 60% of severe neonatal hyperamoniemias. The base of this cycle disorders results in a deficit of its enzymes. Deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase is the most frequently detected. The prognosis depends on the degree of enzyme deficiency, age, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. We report the case of a teenager who was treated with prednisone because of a peripheral facial palsy. He showed a progressive worsening and died a few days later. The high levels of ammonia made suspect a congenital disorder of urea cycle. The postmortem genetic study confirmed it. We studied the family and advised carriers.

2085,"INTRODUCTION: The Mardini-Nyhan or LACHT association is a clinical condition of low prevalence that presents with pulmonary, cardiac and limb abnormalities, in which genetic etiology is not clearly documented to date. OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a 4-month-old child and the literature review of cases reported on this association, with the purpose of exposing the alterations found and thus gui de the early diagnosis of this entity. CLINICAL CASE: 4 months old girl, who admitted to intensive care in mixed respiratory failure, with pulmonary, cardiac and limb disorders that meet criteria for LACHT association, additionally documents hypoplasia of the upper airway, which worsens the evolution, increases the difficulty in mechanical ventilation and favors the fatal outcome at 7 days of hospita lization. CONCLUSIONS: LACTH association is a rare pathology in which the clinical findings make it possible to suspect the diagnosis, this is the first case diagnosed in the Americas and the number 11 case in the world literature and brings as a new finding the association with hypoplasia of the upper airway.",0,1117
2086,"SAPHO syndrome was proposed in the late 80s in order to group different osteoarticular manifestations with specific radiological findings such as the hyperostosis of the front part of the chest wall. Prevalence, etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are unknown, while diagnosis is made both clinically and by the specific gammagraphic image of <<bull horn>> in the sternoclavicular joint. The following case of a 64-year-old woman diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast pT1N0Mx is reported. When studying the extent of the disease, a gammagraphic image of diffuse blast injury in the sterna manubrium was evidenced, which allowed the suspicion of Paget's disease or metastatic injury. Study was completed with a chest CT in which manubrium sclerosis was evidenced, suggesting metastasis. Res ults of the studies pointed out SAPHO syndrome as the most likely diagnostic option. The low tumor stage of the patient prompted the idea of possible alternative diagnoses. A deeper knowledge of this clinical condition may be crucial to avoid mistakes when classifying a subject in more advanced tumor stages, and consequently, to prevent the use of more aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments.",0,1229
2087,The use of optical coherence tomography to diagnose conditions that predominantly affect the photoreceptor layer is postulated as a technique that allows to evaluate the relationship between retinal changes and loss of visual acuity. Two clinical cases are presented on patients with a bilateral decrease of their visual acuity and alteration in chromatic perception. Optical coherence tomography revealed subfoveal focal hypo-reflective defects on the hyper-reflective band (known as the ellipsoid zone).,0,505

2089,"OBJECTIVE: Primary Mucin-producing Urothelial-type Adenocarcinoma of Prostate is extremely infrequent. The presence of signet ring cells is exceptional, more atypical in its mucinous variant. Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical study play a key role. METHODS: Bibliographic review and case report of a 66-year-old man with Ca 19.9 and CEA elevation, and normal PSA levels, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (mucosuria, hesitancy and hematuria). He was diagnosed with mucin-producing urothelial- type adenocarcinoma of the prostate with signet ring cells by transrectal prostate biopsy after multiparametic MRI. RESULTS: We found 23 cases described in our review. No case diagnosed following an elevation of Ca 19.9 was found in the literature. In our case, after diagnosis, he was treated with retropubic radical prostatectomy and bilateral ilio-obturator lymph node dissection, with subsequent normalization of tumor markers; however, he presented secondary pulmonary involvement and pelvic tumor progression despite chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The elevation of associated tumor markers (Ca 19.9, CEA) is extraordinary. There is no treatment algorithm, however surgery (radical prostatectomy) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment represents an alternative in its therapeutic management.",0,1326
2090,"Brachymetatarsia (shortening of the metatarsal) directly affects the transversal arch of the foot causing severe deformities, such as hallux valgus, divergent toes, overlapping toes, metatarsalgia, all of these alter the biomechanics of the foot and gait. Treatment consists of two main techniques, one-stage lengthening with bone graft or elongation through callotaxis with external fixator; there are variants of both techniques used to minimize the disadvantages of each. The objective of treatment must be to return the structural harmony to the forefoot, improving the biomechanics, resulting in a satisfactory outcome for the patients. This article presents a surgical treatment for feet with closed physis to obtain the appropriate metatarsal formula and to reestablish aesthetics and function. This case was treated by means of one-stage lengthening with bone graft to the affected metatarsal; shortening of the adjacent metatarsals; hallux valgus alignment through the necessary osteotomies and the treatment of deformities of the lesser toes as needed. This surgical technique has as one of its advantages the correction of the entire forefoot at one time, without the need of an external fixator and its required postoperative care. Its main disadvantages are its dependence on structural bone graft and the need of postoperative dressing until healing of the bone has taken place. Satisfactory clinical and radiographical outcomes were obtained in treated patient.",0,1476
2091,"Horner's Syndrome (HS) is a neurological syndrome characterised by the triad incomplete pupillary miosis, palpebral ptosis and facial anhidrosis, due to a lesion of the oculosympathetic pathway, formed of three neurons from the hipothalamus to the eye. Identifying its cause is a diagnostic challenge since in spite of its apparent lack of clinical importance, HS can be the first or only manifestation of a serious, or even potentially mortal disorder. We present the case of a 19-year-old male patient with a history of nonspecific ocular pains of two months evolution. He attended the emergency ophthalmological clinic where he was diagnosed with an HS as the first clinical manifestation of Hodgkin lymphoma.",0,712
2092,"Umbilical vessel catheterization is a common procedure in Neonatal Intensive Care Units, especially in very low birthweight infants. Rarely, umbilical artery catheters break, and the retained fragments can cause thrombosis, infection, distal embolization, and even death. Herein, we describe a neonate with clinically significant bilateral limb ischemia developing after removal of a broken umbilical artery catheter. He was under vasodilator treatment in addition to fibrinolytic and anticoagulants. The evolution was favourable.",0,530
2093,"Neuroleptics are a group of drugs widely used in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Among their adverse effects is the ability to trigger a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The diagnosis of NMS is determined by exclusion, and its initial therapeutic management should be the withdrawal of neuroleptics, the administration of benzodiazepines, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is an effective treatment in these patients, and in those cases with a poor response to treatment with antipsychotic drugs. A review is presented on the treatment options and anaesthetic implications of ECT used to handle a patient diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the context of NMS.",0,682
2094,"Bartonella henselae infection is a prevalent illness in Chile. It presents generally as a cat scratch disease or as a prolonged fever syndrome. There are atypical manifestations, which include central nervous system, bone, cardiac and hepato-esplenic compromised. We present an adolescent case with a history of fever, vomiting and ataxia, whose diagnosis was a central nervous system infection by Bartonella henselae associated with a choroid plexus papilloma. This case corresponds to an unusual presentation, with a challenging diagnosis. It is controversial whether to treat this patient, which antimicrobial is the right choice and how long the treatment should be.",0,670
2095,"Nephropatic cystinosis (NC) is a rare disease associated with pathogenic variants in the CTNS gene, with a common variant that consists of a 57kb-deletion involving CTNS. Patients with NC that are treated with cysteamine improve their life quality and expectancy. We report a 12-month-old girl with a poor growth rate since the 4th month of life. She was admitted to the Hospital with acute kidney injury, severe dehydration and metabolic acidosis. She was treated with volume restorative and bicarbonate. Proximal tubulopathy and Fanconi's syndrome was diagnosed. Medical treatment improved renal function that was stabilized in stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since infantile NC was suspected, CTNS genetic analysis was considered. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood to perform PCR for exons 3-12 in CTNS gene and for the specific 57kb-deletion PCR. Afterwards, variant segregation analysis was performed in the familiar trio. The genetic analysis showed that the patient was homozygous for the common 57kb-deletion encompassing CTNS that had been inherited from her asymptomatic heterozygous parents. The molecular confirmation allowed genetic counselling for parents and facilitated the access to cysteamine. Oral treatment with cysteamine resulted in improvement of renal function to CKD stage 3. After 16 months of treatment the patient shows metabolic stability and mild recovery of height. Ophthalmologic follow-up detected ocular cystine crystals 12 months after diagnosis, starting cysteamine drops.",0,1527
2096,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is characterized by the presence of organized thrombotic material in the pulmonary arteries which causes elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance, right heart failure, and death if not treated. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is the treatment of choice and can be curative when the obstruction is proximal. There are cases in which this therapy is not possible, and pulmonary angioplasty is a therapeutic alternative of growing interest. We present our experience with three patients diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in whom pulmonary endarterectomy was not possible and pulmonary angioplasty was performed. All patients showed improvement of functional class, six-minute walk distance, and hemodynamic as well as angiographic parameters.",0,818
2097,"We describe the case of a 23 year old man who had undergone laparoscopic surgery in order to remove a residual mass secondary to a testicular embryonal carcinoma. 15 days after he attended the emergency department complaining about abdominal bloating and copious drainage via the two laparoscopic surgery incisions. Biochemical analysis was consistent with chylous ascites. Although this is uncommon, it is well known that there is more likely to develop chylous ascites after oncologic surgery if retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection is performed1. We decide to start with conservative treatment (dietary modifications) but, as it is not enough, then we decide stop any oral intake and treat him with parenteral nutrition, achieving then total resolution of the ascites.",0,773
2098,"CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old patient was seen during a regular follow up. The main complaint was decreased near-sight vision. Biomicroscopy showed a vascular malformation on the temporal sector of the iris in the left eye, diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation. A second case of similar features is also presented. DISCUSSION: The vascular malformations of the iris may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed or cause recurrent spontaneous hyphemas. Treatment must be individualised and may range from observation to photocoagulation with laser, or even surgery.",0,559
2099,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified leishmaniasis as an uncontrolled and emerging disease. In Ecuador, the only anecdotal cases of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded in 1994 and have not been formally published. This form can be differentiated from classical localized cutaneous leishmaniasis by the number of injuries, the clinical type of the main elementary lesions (papular and acneform), and a weak response to standard treatments. The case we report is a 34-year-old woman who presented with disseminated nodular lesions and ulcers of various sizes with erythematous edges and scars. We report the case and review diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis and the differences that can be found with the other cutaneous variants. The diagnosis requires to be considered by primary care physicians in endemic areas and specialists, taking into account that this presentation can also occur in immunocompetent hosts.",0,935
2100,"A dark pigmented intramedullary mass is very rarely encountered in daily practice, and poses a diagnostic challenge. Several entities have to be considered, including melanin-containing tumours (melanotic ependymoma and melanotic schwannoma) and melanocyte-containing tumours (melanocytoma, primary melanoma and melanoma metastases). The case is presented of a 47 year-old male with a pigmented intramedullary tumour located at T7-T8 level. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed a tumour with hyperintensity on T1 and hypointensity on T2. The tumour was resected partially and treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. The diagnosis of primary intramedullary melanoma (PIM) was established based on histology and the absence of other lesions outside of the CNS. A literature review is presented on the other 26 PIM cases reported. PIM are extremely rare tumours, but are the most frequent cause of pigmented intramedullary tumour. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice whenever possible, followed by radiotherapy.",0,1027
2101,"The Langer-Giedion syndrome, also known as trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II, is a hereditary multisystemic disease part of the group of contiguous gene deletion syndromes. The cause of this syndrome is a heterozygous deletion that involves the chromosomal region 8q23.3-q24.11 and mainly affects genes TRPS1, RAD21, and EXT1. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple osteochondromas in limbs, hypertrichosis, and facial phenotype that includes sparse scalp hair, large laterally protruding ears, a long nose with a bulbous tip. We report the case of a Colombian patient with finding of an 8q23.1-q24.12 deletion by comparative genomic hybridization array technique and classical clinical findings, being the first case reported in Colombia.",0,764
2102,"OBJECTIVE: Vesico-vaginal reflux (VVR) is defined as the reflux of urine into the vaginal vault during voiding, occasionally seen in pre- adolescent girls. The typical history consists in post voiding leaks in the daytime, that correspond to the progressive urine discharge from the vagina, after it has been filled up during micturition. We intend to show two cases presenting with significant urocolpos. METHODS: Description of two clinical cases observed in the pediatric urology office. RESULTS: Clinical case 1.- A 10-year-old girl presented with the complaint of diurnal incontinence (in the immediate post-voiding minutes). The early voiding phase in the cystourethrogram (VCUG) demonstrated progressive gross distension of the vagina (urocolpos) due to retrograde filling as the bladder emptied. The girl was managed with behavioural modifications, and was dry afterwards. Clinical case 2.- A 9-year-old girl presented with history of incomplete voiding. In infancy, she had right-sided vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and was endoscopically treated at the age of 2. VCUG showed VVR, and no VUR. She was then successfully treated with behavioural modifications. Clinical case 3.- A 10-year-old girl complained of diurnal urinary incontinence, described as post voiding leaks. Again, a VCUG showed VVR and a small urocolpos. After re-education of voiding habits, leaks disappeared, but recurred 6 months afterwards, when she acknowledged no adherence to the therapy. DISCUSSION: Between 12 to 15% of girls referred to Urological clinics because of urine incontinence present VVR. In the absence of a clear anatomical obstruction, reflux happens as the urine flow encounters a natural obstacle in the labia majora usually in girls that close their legs as they void. Instructions on proper voiding form a key element in the management of VVR, and if not enough, the behavioural modification consists on a reverse position during voiding.",0,1939
2104,"In September 2012 a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused severe respiratory tract infections in patients from The Arabian Peninsula. It was named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Here, a small series of case stories illustrates how simultaneous analyses for MERS-CoV and other agents of infections at the loca l laboratory resulted in rapid rejection of suspicion of MERS and establishment of the true cause of disease. Relevant treatment was initiated and the patients were discharged from hospital.",1,506
2105,"BACKGROUND: Nesidioblastosis is a rare cause of endocrine disease which represents between 0.5% - 5% of cases. This has been associated with other conditions, such as in patients previously treated with insulin or sulfonylurea, in anti-tumour activity in pancreatic tissue of patients with insulinoma, and in patients with other tumours of the Langerhans islet cells. In adults it is presented as a diffuse dysfunction of beta cells of unknown cause. CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns 46 year-old female, with a history of Sheehan syndrome of fifteen years of onset, and with repeated events characterized with hypoglycaemia in the last three years. Body scan was performed with octreotide, revealing an insulinoma in the pancreatic region. A distal pancreatectomy was performed on the patient. The study reported a pancreatic fragment 8.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm with abnormal proliferation of pancreatic islets in groups of varying size, some of them in relation to the ductal epithelium. Histopathology study was showed positive for chromogranin, confirmed by positive synaptophysin, insulin and glucagon, revealing islet hyperplasia with diffuse nesidioblastosis with negative malignancy. The patient is currently under metabolic control and with no remission of hypoglycaemic events. CONCLUSIONS: Nesidioblastosis is a disease of difficult diagnosis should be considered in all cases of failure to locate an insulinoma, as this may be presented in up to 4% of persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.",0,1496
2106,"Sezary syndrome (SS) is an unusually aggressive T- cell lymphoma characterized by the triad of erythroderma, the presence of more than 1,000 Sezary cells in peripheral blood and lymphadenopathies. It is accompanied by generalized pruritus and poor quality of life. The management of SS depends on its stage, patient comorbidities, and treatment availability. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is the first line of treatment for patients with T-cell lymphomas in stage IVA1, IVA2 or SS. This treatment comprises three phases: leukapheresis, photoactivation and subsequent reinfusion of lymphocytes. As it is an immunomodulatory therapy it does not produce generalized immunosuppression. We report a 76 year-old male with SS stage IIIb initially treated with 12 sessions of ultraviolet phototherapy without response. After 10 well-tolerated sessions of ECP, itching and skin lesions eventually disappeared.",0,905
2107,"OBJECTIVE: To present the results on the use of a single block limbal autograft, combined with amniotic membrane transplantation and sectoral sequential postoperative epitheliectomy of the conjunctiva in 2 patients with unilateral total limbal stem cell deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A single block limbal autograft combined with amniotic membrane transplantation may be sufficient to restore a stable corneal surface, but sometimes sequential sectoral conjunctival epitheliectomy may be required to treat anomalous epithelial remnants.",0,531
2108,"Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery from a Kommerell's diverticulum is a very rare variant of the incomplete vascular ring. Associated symptoms are caused due to tracheal or esophagus compression. Magnetic resonance is the gold standard for diagnosis.

We report three consecutive cases of patients with Kommerell's diverticulum, aberrant left subclavian artery, and right-sided aortic arch.",0,520
2109,"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder agenesis is a very rare congenital abnormality of the biliary tract. The diagnosis is made during surgery, because all preoperative studies have failed to identify this malformation. The purpose of this article is to present a case of gallbladder agenesis diagnosed during surgery, its management, and a review of the literature. CLINICAL CASE: The case involves a sixty-two year- old female, referring to repeated biliary colic symptoms. The abdominal ultrasound diagnosed cholelithiasis. It was impossible to identify the gallbladder during surgery. Diagnosis was confirmed by intra-operative cholangiography. DISCUSSION: Preoperative diagnostic workup has failed to recognise patients with gallbladder agenesis. It is currently recommended to abandon the surgery once this diagnosis is suspected and confirm it by a cholangio-magnetic resonance scan in order to avoid a bile duct injury. CONCLUSIONS: Agenesis of the gallbladder is a rare congenital abnormality of the biliary tree. Every surgeon must keep this rare entity in mind when a ""difficult dissection"" or an anatomic variant is identified during surgery, and make use of an intra-operative cholangiography, mainly to prevent a bile duct injury.",0,1231
2110,"We present a clinical case in occupational health nursing where the worker was showing symptoms of stress caused by a change of residence and related factors at work. A nursing assessment was made following Leininger's theory of Care Diversity and Universality and Sunrise Model, considered suitable for the case. After the assessment, it was determined that the factors associated with the migratory event triggered the reported symptoms, and a care plan was drawn up with monthly telephone contact follow-up and reassessment at 3months. A holistic approach containing social and cultural elements, together with the use of standardised nurse language are very useful in cases such as the one presented.",0,704
2111,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK. We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses. METHODS: We report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection. We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes. FINDINGS: A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1.2 x 10(6) copies per mL). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. INTERPRETATION: We have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.

2112,"The inflammatory pseudotumour of the head and neck is a benign lesion, extremely rare outside the cranial orbits. A case is presented of an inflammatory pseudotumour not associated with the IgG4-related disease. The pseudotumour was found as a solitary mass in the infratemporal fossa of a young woman who complained of otalgia and hearing loss. A clear image of the lesion was obtained using an (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET. After the histopathological diagnosis, and treatment with corticosteroids, a second (18)F-FDG PET was performed. The metabolic image had returned to normal, and the previously observed mass disappeared. A brief review is presented of the studies examining this type of lesion.",0,716
2113,"CLINICAL CASE: A 43 year-old woman consulted due to 2 months of swelling on the superolateral side of the left orbit, with pain and erythema. An excisional biopsy was performed that revealed vasculitis with polyangiitis of the lacrimal gland. A systemic study showed that no other system was compromised. DISCUSSION: Orbital involvement occurs in up to 60% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The involvement of the lacrimal gland is rare and often unilateral. Serological tests are generally negative, both in initial stages, as in localized forms of the disease.",0,579
2114,"High-pressure injection into the hand causes a small skin lesion but severe subcutaneous tissue damage, which can result in permanent functional loss or amputation. Urgent and appropriate treatment is decisive. We present the case of an industrial painter who injected oil-based paint with a high-pressure gun into his left index finger. He was admitted to Accidents and Emergencies, where tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotic therapy were adminis-tered. Then, within four hours of his arrival at the hospital, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgical debridement. A year after the injury the finger's active and passive range of motion was complete, although paling of the skin together with hypersensitivity and dysfunction occurred on exposure to cold. The severity of these lesions, even if their initial appearance is benign, must be recognized and an immediate surgical debridement of the entire ischemic tissue should be performed, because delay in treatment is associated with higher rates of complication.
